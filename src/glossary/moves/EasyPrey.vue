        Pickpocketing, as an isolated move, is another action that I like to leave off the table.  It's not that I dislike the moves, or that I don't think they work out.  More like, in a fickle-artist manner I always think I can do better by making some variant of it (like this).  It probably isn't better, but still I like it.  In this particular case I tried to trade off the narration of, "whatever it is, it's stolen now" with, "whatever it is, here's how you can steal it".  And I think that's an okay tradeoff, so long as players aren't upset about making (in all likelihood) two rolls to get the thing instead of one.
