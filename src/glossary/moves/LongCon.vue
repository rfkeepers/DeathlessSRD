        I have trouble writing moves whose effects stretch out across longer periods of time.  Or perhaps that's an inherently difficult format for pbta moves.  Whatever the case, while I like this move in general, I'm not 100% certain it's working exactly the way I want to.  Or, alternatively, that I want it to be a long-form move at all.  Fun to write, but perhaps not as fun to play out.
