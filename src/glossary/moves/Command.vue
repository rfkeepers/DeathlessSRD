        A spin on the persuade move, for players who like to do the lawful thing.  I tend to prefer specific lenses on a basic move like these over the broader, stat-swapping versions like, "when you Persuade a character by citing the law, roll FORCE instead of GLAMOUR".  The worry is that I end up with an overly restrictive slice, and so it never really sees the light of day, where the more generic stat swap would have gotten both more traction and more appreciation.
