    MC Agenda
</h2>
<Options bullet="⇀" :options="[
    'Make the world crooked, remorseless, and hungry.',
    'Make the people layered, surprising, and real.',
    'Fill the characters\' lives with barbed hooks.',
    'Play to find out what happens.',
]" />
<br>
You can read about each of these points individually in <router-link to="/heart">The Heart</router-link> of the game.  The overarching goal of the agenda is to provide you with a set of guiding principles.  When the world you create looks and feels and acts like what the agenda describes, then you're playing the game as intended.  Anytime you're stuck on a decision, especially when you're not sure how to move forward with a scene or what new element to introduce, turn to this list and ask, "how do I make the world feel like my agenda?"
<br><br>
Next are your Principles.  If the agenda is a compass to point you in the right direction, principles are a map with the roads that can take you there.  Use them to answer questions like, "how do I make the world seem hungry?" or "where do I plant these hooks?"  The Agenda and Principles both exist in the Conversation.  They are not mechanics.  A player doing this or that will not trigger a principle.  No rule will say, "use your agenda here".  This guidance is a foundation to build the rest of the game upon.
<br><br>
Finally, you get a list of MC Moves.  These are mechanical: a layer of rules that float on top of the conversation.  Moves describe what you are able to do.  The specific tools at your disposal for affecting change in the moment.

    PBTA Principles
</h2>
<Options bullet="⇀" :options="[
    'Begin and end with the fiction.',
    'Address the characters before the players.',
    'Ask dangerous questions and wield the answers.',
    'Tell players the requirements or consequences, then ask.',
    'Give the players information freely and honestly.',
    'Think offscreen, too.',
]" />
<br>
Many of your principles are common throughout the various PBTA games.  The wording may change a little here or there, but the underlying advice remains similar throughout.  The suggestions here will help maintain the general approach to play in a way that helps not only the game succeed at large, but sets you up to focus on the moves and principles specifically tailored to Deathless.

<h4 id="the_fiction">
    ⇀ Begin and end with the fiction
</h4>
All actions in the game should be grounded in the fiction, even when the rules are involved.  Moves aren't invoked directly.  Players should describe the things their character does in the fiction, and that fiction then triggers one of their moves.  If Sara says, "I want to Harm them, so I guess that's an Overwhelm?", take a moment to pause and discuss how that happens.  Does her character attack with a weapon?  Are they verbally dressing someone down?  What exactly does she say or do to trigger Overwhelm?  These details are important to help everyone at the table create a mental picture of how the moment plays out.  They'll also help you understand what happens to Sara's character afterward, what position they end up in and, if you have the opportunity to make a move, how you can leverage that position in your reaction.
<br><br>
Likewise, the outcome should also occur in the fiction.  If Sara's character slashes an opponent with their knife, the result must be more than "your opponent takes 1 Harm".  Someone just got cut the fuck up.  Where were they hit?  How badly?  How do they respond, assuming they're still alive?  Any action that instigates fictional change must result in fictional aftermath.
<br><br>
You're bound to this principle as much as the players.  When you use one of your own moves, make it happen in the fiction.  Disguise the consequence in a way that flows naturally from the current moment.  Don't say, "I'm going to destroy your resources", when you can say, "the paper in your cart has caught fire, one of the stray embers must have fallen inside".  Instead of, "I'm turning your safety into danger", say, "Bogan left to take a piss ten minutes ago, and he still hasn't come back.  Something is up."

<h4 id="address_characters">
    ⇀ Address the characters before the players
</h4>
To keep the conversation directed at the fiction, address the players as their characters, not as people in control of characters.  When you ask a player what their character does, you're having a conversation about some separate fictional event, and creating a story by proxy.  When you say the character's name and ask what they do, the resulting conversation becomes the fiction, and is the story itself.
<br><br>
Inversely, when you need to talk about things outside of the fiction- to address safety concerns, check in with the group, or whatever else- you have a clear divide between fiction and reality.  Address the players at this time, not the characters.

<h4 id="ask_questions">
    ⇀ Ask dangerous questions and wield the answers
</h4>
Because you, like the players, are playing to find out what happens, you can't be expected to know everything about the fiction surrounding you.  Be curious, and be a fan of what your players might have ideas for.  Ask them what they think of the situation, about themselves and each other.  Ask them what they're scared might happen.  Be bold and ask about topics beyond their own character: why is the world this way?  What do the people here think of their rulers?  What name do the people here pray to, and is that psychopomp alive?  And, of course, always ask them, "what do you do?"
<br><br>
Once you have your answers, wield them.  Change the world.  Manifest adversaries and interference.  Bring those answers to life in small and large ways both.  The players may not control the world like you do, but by planting the seeds of their ideas you encrich the fiction in ways that everyone cares about.  And when everyone cares about the fiction, they've given it teeth to bite back at them.

<h4 id="give_info">
    ⇀ Give the players information freely and honestly
</h4>
All roleplay deals with the control of knowledge in some form or another, but remember your agenda: play to find out what happens, not play to trickle information down to the players.  Duplicity and secrets are at odds with the nature of the converation, and tend to sow contention between the players and MC.  Trust your players to handle an open flow of information.  Help them be are aware of, and buy into, the dramatic irony of the situation.

<h4 id="think_offscreen">
    ⇀ Think offscreen, too
</h4>
The actions and reactions of the world mustn't always occur in the immediate space around the players' characters.  The world lives and breathes even when it isn't observed.  What are people scheming in the background?  How do they maneuver their advantage?  Things are constantly changing behind the characters' backs.  Don't be afraid to make changes offscreen while the characters act successfully onscreen.
<br>

<h2 id="deathless_principles">
    Deathless' Principles
</h2>
<Options bullet="⇀" :options="[
    'Spin webs, leave threads unattached.',
    'Fill the story with frequent strife and transient relief.',
    'Deal in costly decisions, misfortune, and trouble that always comes looking.',
    'Give nothing away freely.',
    'Make fraught situations deadly.',
    'Use the unnatural to talk about the human.',
    'Pursue accountability for the actions commmitted.',
    'Manipulate loyalties or turn them against each other',
]" />
<br>
These principles, in contrast to the prior set, are specific to the tone and atmosphere of this game, independent of other pbta titles.  Their purpose is to help funnel you towards your agenda, to help you portray a hungry world, barbed hooks, and real people.

<h4 id="spin_webs">
    ⇀ Spin webs, leave threads unattached
</h4>
Every character has some connection to another, but you won't always know whom strings lead to.  It's important to leave space for the unknown.  The more your players engage with a character and their relationships, the more opportunity these connections have to attach to someone.
<br><br>
Lean on your players.  Let them imagine how the characters relate, and how they're caught up in the web of things.  Engage with the table to establish those connections, even if in subtle ways ("Do you think this soldier reports directly to the captain?", "Would Crim gossip about these details to the Consul's eyes and ears?").  That will build relationships in the open, in a way that everyone can follow along with and buy in to.

<h4 id="strife_and_relief">
    ⇀ Fill the story with frequent strife and transient relief
</h4>
The conversation needs to have a certain rhythm and pace.  Most times it should be engaged and dangrous, loaded with tension between characters, probably some action, and paved with choices that leave their marks on people.
<br><br>
Every now and then it also needs breathing room.  Partly for contrast.  In part for decompression.  Don't equate relief to idleness; you get to be idle when the table takes a break.  Moments of relief should indulge some part of the players' or their characters' needs: give them joy or gratitude, encourage them to reflect on their behavior, let them <i>Enjoy Respite</i> and make connections with other characters.  Just as the frequent strife should actively increase the tension, the downtime between must relieve it.

<h4 id="misfortune">
    ⇀ Deal in costly decisions, misfortune, and trouble that always comes looking
</h4>
The characters do not lead simple, easygoing lives.  They are exceptional people making their way through exceptional circumstances.  You, as the arbiter of these circumstances, are to ensure that every corner they turn reveals new drama.  Hardship and upset are their bread and butter of living.  At every opportunity, every time the players look to you and ask, "what now?", turn to this principle.

<h4 id="no_freebies">
    ⇀ Give nothing away freely
</h4>
Friends, alliances, opportunities, safety, information, love, power, followers, attention, support, success; nothing in this world is handed to the players.  If they want it, the characters either need to pay, to work for it, or to take it despite resistance.

<h4 id="deadliness">
    ⇀ Make fraught situations deadly
</h4>
Make characters die.  Player characters, your npcs, it doesn't matter.  The preservation of life is not your goal.  Let your darlings get killed.  Kill them off, if you have to.  Whatever you do, never pull your punches, and don't let the playes' pull theirs either.  If one character moves with the intent to kill, then another character dies.

<h4 id="unnatural_humanity">
    ⇀ Use the unnatural to talk about the human
</h4>
Deathless is invested in humanity, in the human condition.  It should not exclude the fantastic.  In fact, I encourage you to include supernatural elements: monsters, magic, demons, gods and the like.  The line that divides, the line that shouldn't be crossed, is where the unnatural itself becomes what's interesting about the story.  Wizardry is not about magic, it is about the pursuit of invention where terrible means justify impressive ends.  Always loop back to people.  The people affected, the people involved, and the people who turn a blind eye so long as they benefit by the results.

<h4 id="pursue_accountability">
    ⇀ Pursue accountability for the actions commmitted
</h4>
No action occurs in a vacuum.  Every person is connected to other people.  Every object has meaning to someone.  Whether good or ill, the players' actions have consequences.  The results ripple out to affect others.  Maybe sometimes the outcome goes unaddressed, but you should always look for the chance to involve the consequences for past choices.  If the characters did good, seek to reward them (this ties in to <i>Give nothing away freely</i>); and on the contrary, don't let bad behavior go unpunished.

<h4 id="manipulate_loyalties">
    ⇀ Manipulate loyalties or turn them against each other
</h4>
Don't fear allowing your (figurative) paladin to turn on the rogue, now and then.  If the PCs all have to play nice and get along with each other, you'll never discover where they draw their lines, or how much they need to be pressed before they're willing to cross over.  Deathless wants and expects contention among PCs.  Let NPCs coerce and divide the party.  See if you can bind them into conflicting allegiances.  Give your players motivations that contrast one another.  If you can pit them against each other, you can find ways to bring them together again afterward, too.
<br>
<hr>

<h2 id="mc_moves">
    MC Moves
</h2>
While the players and MC both have moves, yours work in a very different way than theirs.  You never roll, and your moves never fail.  When you say that something happens, it happens.  And whatever that is, it happens in the fiction.  This is part of beginning and ending in the fiction.  You are allowed to make statements that are fictionally true, so long as they are backed by a move.
<br><br>
Although your moves describe what you're allowed to do, they do so in broad strokes and intentionally leave much to the imagination.  They're not not solely for retaliating or punishing the players.  View them, fundamentally, as tools to keep the story interesting and tense.  Sometimes, yes, you'll use them as a response to a missed roll.  Other times it's just to prod a stalled conversation or tweak the urgency of the moment.
<br>

<h3 id="moves_when">
    When To Make Moves
</h3>
<h4 id="after_a_move">
    ⇀ After a player move allows it
</h4>
Most player moves in the game will describe what to do on a Successful or Partially successful roll, but won't say what to do on a Miss.  Other times the move will state that you get to make a move in addition to the other outcomes.  In both cases you are allowed to make a move "as hard as you want".  As hard as you want doesn't need to mean you assign the maximum punishment to the character, although you are allowed to do so.  It means your move can affect them as directly or indirectly as you please.
<br><br>
On the topic of directness, Deathless functions best when characters fail forward.  That is, a Missed move doesn't need to prevent them from achieving their goals, especially since that often kills the scene's the momentum.  In most situations it is better to let the character succeed and then come at them sideways with a new problem.

<h4 id="what_next">
    ⇀ When anyone looks at you to see what happens next
</h4>
Anytime the players aren't moving the scene forward on their own, they're probably looking at you to do it for them.  Maybe this is because the conversation stalled.  Maybe something new is in the scene and they aren't sure how to approach it.  Maybe, most simply, they just made their own move and are curious to see what happens next.  Whatever the cause, this is your opportunity to push things in a certain direction, to set up new tension and danger, and keep the scene moving forward.

<h4 id="golden_opportunity">
    ⇀ If given a golden opportunity
</h4>
A golden opportunity happens when the players leave a previous event unaddressed.  If you put danger or opposition in the scene, and the players don't do anything about it, you now have a golden opportunity to follow through on that setup.

<h3 id="after_a_move">
    After Making A Move
</h3>
Once you've made a move, always ask the players, "what do you do?"  This is the most essential part of the conversation.  Your moves are your way of abiding your principles and fulfilling your agenda.  The players have their own agenda, and must get their own opportunity to act.

<h3 id="moves">
    Moves
</h3>
<Options bullet="⇀" :options="[
    'Reveal an unwelcome truth',
    'Turn safety to danger',
    'Make their move cause more trouble than it solves',
    'Harm them',
    'Remind them of their place in the world',
    'Compel someone to complicate the situation',
    'Claim their resources',
    'Tug at the strings of Entanglements',
    'Advance an antagonist\'s position, on or offscreen',
    'Offer an opportunity',
]" />

<h4 id="reveal_truth">
    ⇀ Reveal an unwelcome truth
</h4>
This is your standard move for stepping things up a notch.  The truth can be distant and informational (your contact across town was murdered yesterday), or close by and intimate (Beth is trying to stab you).  It's your way to let the players know just how bad of a spot they're in now, or are about to be in- ratcheting up the tension of the moment- while still giving the players all the opportunities to react.

<h4 id="turn_safety">
    ⇀ Turn safety to danger
</h4>
Expose their hideout.  Separate the group.  Show the flaws in their equipment.  Whatever it is they have to help them feel safe and secure, strike at it.  Make them vulnerable, and aware of it.

<h4 id="cause_trouble">
    ⇀ Make their move cause more trouble than it solves
</h4>
If a player misses and you aren't sure how to turn the moment around against them, then don't turn it around.  Run with it.  Let them succeed and cause havoc in the doing.

<h4 id="harm_them">
    ⇀ Harm them
</h4>
The most standard of all retaliations: attack the character.  Harm encompasses all manner of insult and injury.  You can cause pain, if you simply want to send a message.  Or you can inflict Conditions and Wounds.  Keep in mind that you should <i>make fraught situations deadly</i>.  The PCs can't die, after all.  You never need to worry about doing too much Harm.

<h4 id="remind_them">
    ⇀ Remind them of their place in the world
</h4>
Whether your game postures the PCs as mundane or important, loved or loathed, all the people in the world have an opinion of them.  Sometimes they have direct opinions about the individual characters, borne of prior interaction or reputation.  Other times its an opionion about what they are: deathless, humanity undying and unbounded.  Whatever the sentement may be, show it.  Remind them of the differences that set them apart from others, and of peoples inclination to carry strong opinions about such differences.

<h4 id="compel_them">
    ⇀ Compel someone to complicate the situation
</h4>
Every character, PCs and NPCs alike, have compulsions which they find difficult to resist.  These might apply broadly, like yearnings for lucre or the instinct to fight over any insult.  They may be specific: the unwillingness to tell a certain person no; or to protect a ward from everything, even the joys of life.  Call out those tendencies.  Dangle these temptations and seduce characters into trouble and complication.

<h4 id="claim_resources">
    ⇀ Claim their resources
</h4>
Coin, equipment, supplies, leverage, help, secrets, contacts.  Whatever they have, especially the things they need, can be taken from them.  Destroy it if you want, or make them work to get it back.

<h4 id="tug_at_entanglements">
    ⇀ Tug at the strings of Entanglements
</h4>
Entanglements give you pawns to move around, to place into danger or in positions of power.  Though, this change doesn't always need to involve risk or power dynamics.  Another way to twist the relationship is to change how the characters percieve one another.  Color the players instincts with conflicting motivations.  Make the people they're saving do wrong, or make grudges useful or valuable.  Turn it around and inform the npcs of the PCs troublemaking and misdeeds.

<h4 id="advance_antagonism">
    ⇀ Advance an antagonist's position, on or offscreen
</h4>
Sometimes the most simple move to make is to give your antagonists a better position.  Do this when you're <i>thinking offscreen</i>, too.  Imagine how the world is moving to position itself against the players.  Keeping the pieces in the background in mind can be especially useful when you're stumped on how to respond to a player's move in the moment.  Let them succeed, and then kick something offscreen into action.
<br><br>
Importantly, this is not the same thing as "figuring it out later".  The fiction needs to change now, not down the road.  But the effets don't need to come down on the player immediately, either.  Start a new clock.  Tell the players which pieces are moving and where.  Or, at the very least, describe someone who is or will be taking interest in them, and why.

<h4 id="opportunity">
    ⇀ Offer an opportunity
</h4>
The most simple move is the last one: give the characters something they can do.  Remember to <i>give nothing away freely</i>.  But do give to the players, at least as much as you take.  Give them ways to engage.  Give them challenges to overcome and characters to meet.  Give them invitations to be excited about the conversation.  Give them the spotlight.  Give them rewards, even.  Sometimes, when you're trying to <i>fill the story with transient relief</i>, relief can be the opportunity and engagement the cost.
