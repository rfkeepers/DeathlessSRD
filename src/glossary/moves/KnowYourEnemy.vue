        Another Understand Someone variation.  Do I have too many of these?  I think I've lost count.  I'm certainly not writing as many Overwhelm variants.  I wrote the Tactician quite early on, and the Gambler much later.  In review, I think I might have wrote the same concept twice with differing themes.  Or, at least, this move certainly overlaps with the "read their tell" move.  Maybe a little overlap is okay?
