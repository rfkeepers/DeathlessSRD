        <h3 class="lineTo indent">Design Thoughts</h3>
        This move originated back when the game had a fair bit of crunch around its combat.  The Butcher background as a whole, actually, was one of the first written to that design.  I feel like you can still feel the combat focus here, and I think that's okay; it's not like players aren't allowed to invest into that.  At the same time, I sometimes feel weird re-reading the move, because I think so much about its combat history, and that makes it feel distinct from the other backgrounds.
