        <h2 id="game">The Game</h2>
        Deathless is a game about flawed and troublesome characters who are never allowed to die.  A person without the fear of death is a person without fear.  At the table, we play to find out where those characters' lines are drawn: which boundaries do they preserve, and which are they willing to step across?

    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2 id="pbta">Powered By The Apocalypse</h2>
        Deathless is part of the PBTA school of games, which are based on <a href="https://lumpley.games/apocalypseworld/">Apocalpyse World</a> by D. Vincent and Meguey Baker.  If you're familiar with other pbta games (possibly: Masks, Dungeon World, or Monster of the Week), then you probably know what you're in for, more or less.
        <br><br>
        If you're new to PBTA games, here's what you're in for: the experience is light on rules, heavy on the narrative, and has strong opinions about which stories and spaces the game is best at exploring.
    </div>

    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2 id="conversation">The Conversation</h2>
        Playing this game is, fundamentally, a conversation between the people at the table.  The Master of Ceremonies (or MC), who takes the role of the world around the players, describes what's happening and asks the Players what they do.  The Players then tell the MC (or another player) how they act, and ask what happens next.  This continues as the story unfolds and arcs run their course.  The rules of the game should be treated as a participant in the conversation, too.  They'll interject when necessary, most often to help arbitrate differences.
        <br><br>
        Like any good conversation the game works best with a couple goals in mind.  There are no formal rules about who gets to talk and when, people contribute when they feel like it.  Everyone should have an opportunity to add to the conversation.  The topic should always move forward to new and interesting spaces.  Everyone takes part in directing the content, towards the things they want to explore, and away from the things they don't.
        <br><br>
        All the things said at the table sum up to create "the fiction".  Since the fiction is the story, that means every person involved is a co-author.  No one person at the table has special agency over the conversation that others do not.  We all play to find out what happens.
    </div>

    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2 id="players">Players</h2>
        Each player creates a character (a Player Character, or PC), one of the deathless, whom they control for the lifespan of the story.  These characters all have unique history, relationships, and compulsions, and the player's job is to bring out those features in dramatic context.
    </div>

    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2 id="mc">Master of Ceremonies</h2>
        The MC puppets the world around the PCs, acting out the Non-Player Characters (aka, NPCs) and their motives and reactions.  Thier job, by pulling at these strings, is to maintain the tempo and tension of the game.  Like the other people at the table they may arrive with topics in mind (or they might not, planning ahead isn't necessary) but they, too, are here to discover the story, not to prescribe it.

        <h2 id="agendas">Agendas</h2>
        Deathless is not designed to play all possible stories and games.  It wants to investigate humanity, weakness, and character faults.  It wants to have the players question, "what have I done?", more than they ask, "how do I want to do it?".  The scope is fantastical- but from a ground-level perspective- setting the supernatural as a foil to ourselves to see how that makes us, people, more interesting.  If a character seeks to slay a god, you shouldn't ask if they have the power to do it.  You should ask what drives a person to kill their god, and why they will not be received as saviors on their return.
        <br><br>

        To steer the tone of play toward these stories, everyone at the table has an agenda.  The Players, the MC, secretly even the rules themselves.  These agendas form a contract, of sorts.  An agreement between all involved that they are playing the same game.

        <div class="spaceAbove">
            <h3 id="player_agenda">Player Agendas</h3>

            <h4 class="noTopMargin">⇀ Play a real person: flawed, engaged, and aware</h4>
            Chracters should behave like real people.  They're at their best when: Flawed- able to make mistakes and act irrationally or in their own self-interest.  Engaged- seeking earnest and active involvement in what's going on around them.  Aware- thoughtful, introspective, and self-aware, just like the player.

            <h4>⇀ Embrace all consequences</h4>
            Characters in deathless are not superhuman.  The world around them is inhospitable.  Trouble and tragedy are an expected part of play.  If your goal is to avoid trial and failure you'll end up fighting the game itself.  Allow your character to experience hardship.  Dig into that, and explore it.

            <h4>⇀ Appreciate the fragility of good connections</h4>
            Your character cannot die, but that isn't the case for everyone in the world.  On the contrary, you're the exception, and part of living forever means enduring loss.  But loss doesn't make life worth living.  Accept loss, but live to find friendship, hope, love, and dedication.  Hold tight to those things.  Dig your fingers in and make the world pry them from your grip.

            <h4>⇀ Don't be afraid to make different commitments than your fellow players</h4>
            You and your fellow players might all be in this together, but that doesn't mean you'll always share the same outlook on the situation.  When you disagree with the path the others are heading down- or even further, you want try and stop them from walking it- go ahead and chase that conflict.  The rules are ready to handle your quarrels, and you should trust the table to bring things around again afterward.

            <h3 id="mc_agenda">MC Agendas</h3>

            <h4 class="noTopMargin">⇀ Make the world crooked, remorseless, and hungry</h4>
            Give your world opportunities to eat people alive.  Actually, do more than that:  don't wait for opportunites to arrive, make the world lunge out and snatch people up.  Make it crooked, willing to cheat and backstab its way to the next bite.  Make it remorseless, indifferent about who it might chew up and spit out and how that choice could affect others, or itself.  Finally, make it hungry, which draws two implications.  First, that your world is always looking for its next meal.  Second, that it isn't at a buffet; it has to work for what it gets, just like the rest of us.

            <h4>⇀ Make the people layered, surprising, and real</h4>
            All people have names, lives, desires and secrets.  Lackeys harbor precious joys.  Leaders expeiences crisis.  Anyone drifting through the background has an ambition.  Importantly, it is not your job to write backstories in advance.  Your characters may surprise you as much as they do the players, and that's good.  That's real.

            <h4>⇀ Fill the characters' lives with barbed hooks</h4>
            Use the characters to lay hooks in your player's skin, then tug at the strings.  Pull them in different directions.  Drag them toward conflict.  Hold the line tight behind them and ask if they are willing to keep moving forward.  You have no threat of mortality to leverage at your players.  All you have are the people who mean something to them.

            <h4>⇀ Play to find out what happens</h4>
            Show up to the table with as little or as much preparation as you want (we suggest the former).  Readiness is not as important as flexibility.  Expect the players to surprise you.  Expect to surprise yourself sometimes.  The goal is to discover a story through play, not to tell a written tale.

        <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
        At this point you've read the agendas and, hopefully, recognized the tone they're trying to set.  Whether you have or not, it bears repeating: Deathless wants you to tell stories that involve emotional distress, difficult decisions, and hard situations.  In order to allow that to happen, you must trust the other people at the table, and feel safe to tell this story together with them.
        <br><br>

        Trust and safety are not a switch that can be toggled.  The nature of role playing, improvisation, and inhabiting another character means we all, at times, find ourselves in territory that we did not, despite intentions, expect to enter.  We may say, do, and feel things that we didn't think we ever would.  We can surprise ourselves to find that a line was crossed, especially when we were the one to cross it.  These revelations can, when handled appropriately and in the correct environment, encourage valuable discussion and introspection.  Outside of that environment we risk hurting each other, and that is never the goal.
        <br><br>

        Finally, please keep in mind that you, the individual, are in charge of your well-being and safety.  The game can hand you the tools, but it will not use them for you.  Open communication with your fellow players is your responsibility.  Using the tools to communicate your feelings is your responsibility.  Respecting and supporting your fellow players when they use the tools is your responsibility.  The tools below are a minimal recommendation for maintaining safety and trust at your table.  If you have additional tools you'd like to use, you are welcome and encouraged to incorporate them.

        <h3>Before</h3>
        Before means both "before you decide to play this game" and also "before each session that you play".  Likewise, it doesn't mean "only before, and no other time".  You can come back and revisit these any time you need.  But at minimum, make sure you review them before you play.

        <h4>CATS</h4>
        Everyone should be able to agree on the following: Concept, Aim, Tone, and Subject matter.  Make sure there is consensus at the table about what you're playing and where it's taking you.

        <h4>Lines and Veils</h4>
        A line expresses a hard limit, a boundary dividing what may and may not appear in the game.  A veil describes concepts that are allowed, but that shouldn't be visited in detail.  Players may declare these publically, or they may share them in private with the MC.  Either way, in the end, everyone at the table should have access to the lines and veils in use.

        <h3>During</h3>
        <h4 class="noTopMargin">X Card</h4>
        Depending on your circumstance the X may be a physical card which players can reach out and touch, or it may be the act of saying, typing, or showing an X.  A player may tap the X card any time that they are uncomfortable with the current scene.  Once tapped, the scene either changes course or cuts to somewhere else.  No questions asked, no explanations needed.
        <br>

        <h4>Support Flower</h4>
        The support flower is similar to the X card, but more nuanced in execution.  It allows for participants to request that the scene stop (red), but also for it to slow down or proceed with caution (yellow).  It also allows participants to ask for more, or to dig in deeper (green) when they like where the scene is headed.

        <h4>Open Door Policy</h4>
        Participation in the game is not required.  Anyone may leave or disconnect for any reason, without fear of judgement from others.

        <h3>After</h3>
        <h4 class="noTopMargin">Debriefs</h4>
        Everyone at the table should have an opportunity to check in with each other and address feelings.  This can be done in private between participants, or with the group as a whole.  It isn't necessary to wait for the end of the session to debrief.  Taking breaks in-between scenes, especially to follow up after an emotionally charged moment, is a great time to administer aftercare.
