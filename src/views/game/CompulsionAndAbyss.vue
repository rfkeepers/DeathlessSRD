    Compulsion &amp; Abyss
</h1>

<h2 id="compulsion">
    Compulsion
</h2>
For some, living is the sequence of urges towards ego, violence, and warped curiosity.  Those are the characters in this game.  Each and every one, player and NPC alike, could spin you weeping tales of sins and mistakes, poor timing and poorer placement.  The truth is so much more simple: they wanted to do these things.  They enjoyed it.
<br><br>
Hardwired reward separates a character's Compulsions from their run-of-the-mill troublemaking.  An afternoon drag on a cigarette means nothing to most.  To an addict fighting to quit, a quick smoke hidden behind the corner of a building compresses nicotine and adrenaline into elation.  It's as much about the pleasurable guilt as the action itself.  And so, like addicts, <em>the characters need their fix</em>, to settle haywire nerves, to get that rush, or to feign proof that they really are in control of their world, however desperate that proof may be.

    Invoking Compulsion
</h2>
You can engage with your character's Compulsions whenever you want, whenver you feel it makes sense in the fiction.  However, you'll more likely to want to avoid taking on the extra problems.  The thing about compulsion, the nature of the idea, is that characters often get into that business without conscious choice.  So while you <i>could</i> bring it into the scene on your own, it usually falls on the MC and other players to give you a nudge.
<br><br>
The MC can call out a character's Compulsion as one of their moves.  When they compel a PC, the player has two options: follow the MC's call and play out their Compulsion (earning a Resilience in the process, if they meet the requirements), or spend a Resilience to resist their urges.  Players can call out each-other out with:

<h2 id="resilience">
    Resilience
</h2>
Resilience is the lingering glow of transient bliss.  It's the adrenaline feedback of getting away with trouble, the relief after decompression, the currency of indomitable tolerance.  It's how much shit a character can deal with and still come out ready to smile wide and swing hard.

<h3 id="getting_resilience">
    Getting More
</h3>
You can gain Resilience in a couple ways: the MC can hand some out when the opportunity ties in with one of their moves.  Compulsions, above, are the most reliable and available way, though that gain is likely offset by the trouble you've caused along the way.  If you're looking for a safe alternative, you could seek out a moment of intimacy instead:

<h3 id="spending_resilience">
    Spending It
</h3>
Once gained, you have that Resilience until spent.  Imagine it like an emotional battery; good disposition in reserve for when you need to block the world from getting to you, or push yourself to greater effort.  One of its uses is for defense: when you would take a Condition, you can spend a Resilience to ignore it instead.  You can't use Resilience to clear an existing Condition, however.  It's all about being able to stand tall against the Harm and show how, in that moment, it doesn't hold any sway over you.
<br><br>
Another usage is to improve your roll when you use a move.  Normally, you'll roll as many dice as your stat provides: if you have a Resolve of 3, you roll 3d6.  Spending Resilience increases that pool by 1.  That would take your 3 Resolve and let you roll 4d6 instead.
<br><br>
Finally, when your character has taken on a Persona, Resilience can be used to fuel those moves instead of Abyss.  Each Persona move lists its costs underneath the name of the move, usually something like <i>Cost: 1 Abyss | 1 Resilience</i>.  That means if this move is part of your current Persona, you can only use it by spending 1 Resilience.  It's not a necessity, though.  You can still also use the move by burning an Abyss, whether or not you the required Resilience to spend.

    The Abyss
</h2>
Life has a way of accruing woe, especially the way that the characters in Deathless live it.  Depravity and affliction pool into a well that fills a person with still, bleak water, glassy in its self-reflection.  That accumulation, whether it collects to a pool or a sea, is the Abyss.  Call it horror or guilt or sin or anguish, if you want, it's all the same: the Abyss is weight, fatigue, waiting for its moment to drown someone in it.
<br><br>
Few understand the Abyss like the players' characters do.  Many sense it inside themselves: a perception with presence but no name or shape, try as they might to wrest it into being.  Some may even have an instinct for it in others, able to ferret out the signs through eldritch or accidental methods.  But it isn't until death that one truly faces themselves with unblinking comprehension.  The deathless alone know what it means to be immersed.

<h3 id="feeding_the_abyss">
    Feeding
</h3>
The more your character lives through Deathless, the more likely that one of the following is going to happen: they're going to get killed, they're going to kill someone else, or they're going to witness- possibly even participate in- something that crosses an unbearable line.  Each of these feeds something to the Abyss.
