        Every time I read this move I find it to be, well, utilitarian would be the word, I think.  It does a functional thing.  Not an impressive thing.  Or a surprising thing.  Or an exhilirating thing.  Just a functional thing.  And perhaps that can be okay.  Perhaps not every move needs to be epic.  But I sometimes wonder if players read utilitarian moves and think to themselves, "yeah, I guess I'll use it, just cause it's there, but whatever."
