But you also take it "whenever you perform or are complicit in an act which crosses the line of a personal ethos" (like black bile). Woes can be burned to enact terrible, powerful behavior. At some point, instead of losing yourself, you have to contend with your woes. How and when? Well, that depends on the mechanic. Maybe just when the bar tops off? Maybe when you roll under? After introducing woes, I need to refactor how engaging with personas works. When you die, you don't lose your memories. You have to face your woes/agony. In facing them, you learn what persona you unlock/embody. Unlocking personas: When you die, you unlock the persona. but you have to have a minimum of the abyss. every 2, stepping up. So the first unlock requires at least two, the second 4, the third 6, etc. (or, 0, 2, 4, 6, etc). the illusionists condition removal should be gaslighting, and their initial move should be that only one character sees the illusion, or the illusion is weak? Is that too powerful for "I just save it for one person"? Okay, so, the Abyss is not a thing, or a place. It's a `),e("i",null,"state"),t(`. It's the suspension of nonliving. This allows it to exist as it is, and also account for revision of woes. You're not "going to a place" like the abyss. We can still describe it as the sea underneath. What's important is that while in the abyss, all you have is the reflection of your woes. You have yourself and your feelings to contend with, in isolation. Make the abyss a thing. Make it a purgatory. But make that purgatory about focusing on the character, not on some absurd fantastical sea. This is a webpage, right? How about when you level up you need the page for "ask yourself a question". And the answer is your playbook. Ex. "level 1: If people in the world could truly see you, what would they see?"

Vincent and Meguey Baker. If you&#39;re familiar with other pbta games (possibly: Masks, Dungeon World, or Monster of the Week), then you probably know what you&#39;re in for, more or less. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> If you&#39;re new to PBTA games, here&#39;s what to expect: the experience is light on rules, heavy on the narrative, and has strong opinions about which stories and spaces the game inhabits best. The setting, worldbuilding, and characters will be your own, while the game provides the atmosphere and tone. <h2 id="players" data-v-c1864762> Players </h2> Each player at the table creates a character (a Player Character, or PC)- <em data-v-c1864762>one of the deathless</em>- whom they control for the lifespan of the story. A player&#39;s job is to act as that charcter: to say the things the character says, describe what the character does, react to the world as that character would; to bring them to life in dramatic fashion. <h2 id="mc" data-v-c1864762> Master of Ceremonies </h2> The MC puppets all of <em data-v-c1864762>the world</em> around the PCs, acting out the Non-Player Characters (aka, NPCs) and their motives and reactions. Their job, while pulling at the strings, is to maintain the tempo and tension of the game, to react to the PCs actions and, like everyone else, to discover the story as it happens. <h2 id="play" data-v-c1864762> Play </h2> To play this game is to have a <em data-v-c1864762>conversation</em>. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> The MC describes something that&#39;s happening: an event taking place or the actions of an NPC. The Players say how their characters respond. If the PC&#39;s behavior needs to be addressed in a particular way (rules, moves, etc), then the MC and Players work it out as needed. Afterward, the MC says how the world responds, which loops things back to the beginning. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> It works the same if the Players hash out a moment together without the MC&#39;s input. One Player describes what their character does or says. Another PC responds. Then someone else can respond, and so on. The MC can interject at any moment to assert rules and other such arbitrations, as needed. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> There are no rules about who gets to talk and when, people contribute when they feel like it. Everyone should have an opportunity to add to the conversation. The topic should always move forward to new and interesting spaces. Everyone takes part in directing the content, towards the things they want to explore, and away from the things they don&#39;t. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> All the things said at the table sum up to create &quot;the fiction&quot;. Since the fiction is the story, that means <em data-v-c1864762>every person involved is a co-author</em>. No one person at the table has special agency over the conversation that others do not. We all play to find out what happens. <h2 id="moves" data-v-c1864762> Moves </h2> Every now and then the game gets a say in the conversation, too. These are the rules speaking up, helping the table resolve a moment when the fictional outcome isn&#39;t clear on its own, or when the game wants to steer the play in a certain direction. This gets handled through (link-needed to anatomy-of-moves)<b data-v-c1864762>Moves</b>. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> Moves are codified fictional action. They come into play according to a trigger; something like, &quot;When you act with &quot;precision, subtlety, or prior experience&quot;. What this means is when you&#39;re having the conversation and Jen says, &quot;Flynn slides his hand into the Baron&#39;s pocket, sneaking out the key to his house.&quot; The MC should say, &quot;oh, that sounds like you&#39;re trying to Snipe something! That&#39;s a move, let&#39;s roll the dice to find out if you do it!&quot; That&#39;s where the game adds to the conversation: you look up the move Snipe, roll the dice, and do as the move prescribes to learn the results. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762> After that, the conversation turns back to the people at the table. <br data-v-c1864762><br data-v-c1864762><hr data-v-c1864762><h2 id="agendas" data-v-c1864762> Agendas </h2> Deathless is not a good choice for every story out there.

Aware- thoughtful, introspective, and self-aware, just like the player. <h4 data-v-c1864762>\u21C0 Embrace all consequences</h4> Characters in deathless are not superhuman. The world around them is inhospitable. Trouble and tragedy are an expected part of play. If your goal is to avoid trial and failure you&#39;ll end up fighting the game itself.

Dig into that, and explore it. <h4 data-v-c1864762>\u21C0 Appreciate the fragility of good connections</h4> Your character cannot die, but that isn&#39;t the case for everyone in the world. On the contrary, you&#39;re the exception, and part of living forever means enduring loss. But loss doesn&#39;t make life worth living. Accept loss, but live to find friendship, hope, love, and dedication. Hold tight to those things.

Make it remorseless, indifferent about who it might chew up and spit out and how that choice could affect others, or itself. Finally, make it hungry, which draws two implications.

Those are the characters in this game. Each and every one, player and NPC alike, could spin you weeping tales of sins and mistakes, poor timing and poorer placement. The truth is so much more simple: they wanted to do these things. They enjoyed it. <br><br> Hardwired reward separates a character&#39;s Compulsions from their run-of-the-mill troublemaking. An afternoon drag on a cigarette means nothing to most. To an addict fighting to quit, a quick smoke hidden behind the corner of a building compresses nicotine and adrenaline into elation. It&#39;s as much about the pleasurable guilt as the action itself. And so, like addicts, <em>the characters need their fix</em>, to settle haywire nerves, to get that rush, or to feign proof that they really are in control of their world, however desperate that proof may be. <h2 id="invoking_compulsion"> Invoking Compulsion </h2> You can engage with your character&#39;s Compulsions whenever you want, whenver you feel it makes sense in the fiction. However, you&#39;ll more likely to want to avoid taking on the extra problems. The thing about compulsion, the nature of the idea, is that characters often get into that business without conscious choice. So while you <i>could</i> bring it into the scene on your own, it usually falls on the MC and other players to give you a nudge. <br><br> The MC can call out a character&#39;s Compulsion as one of their moves. When they compel a PC, the player has two options: follow the MC&#39;s call and play out their Compulsion (earning a Resilience in the process, if they meet the requirements), or spend a Resilience to resist their urges. Players can call out each-other out with: <br><br>',17),e9=e("h2",{id:"resilience"}," Resilience ",-1),t9=t(" Resilience is the lingering glow of transient bliss. It's the adrenaline feedback of getting away with trouble, the relief after decompression, the currency of indomitable tolerance. It's how much shit a character can deal with and still come out ready to smile wide and swing hard. "),o9=e("h3",{id:"getting_resilience"}," Getting More ",-1),n9=t(" You can gain Resilience in a couple ways: the MC can hand some out when the opportunity ties in with one of their moves. Compulsions, above, are the most reliable and available way, though that gain is likely offset by the trouble you've caused along the way. If you're looking for a safe alternative, you could seek out a moment of intimacy instead: "),s9=e("br",null,null,-1),i9=e("br",null,null,-1),a9=D('<h3 id="spending_resilience"> Spending It </h3> Once gained, you have that Resilience until spent. Imagine it like an emotional battery; good disposition in reserve for when you need to block the world from getting to you, or push yourself to greater effort. One of its uses is for defense: when you would take a Condition, you can spend a Resilience to ignore it instead. You can&#39;t use Resilience to clear an existing Condition, however. It&#39;s all about being able to stand tall against the Harm and show how, in that moment, it doesn&#39;t hold any sway over you. <br><br> Another usage is to improve your roll when you use a move. Normally, you&#39;ll roll as many dice as your stat provides: if you have a Resolve of 3, you roll 3d6. Spending Resilience increases that pool by 1. That would take your 3 Resolve and let you roll 4d6 instead. <br><br> Finally, when your character has taken on a Persona, Resilience can be used to fuel those moves instead of Abyss. Each Persona move lists its costs underneath the name of the move, usually something like <i>Cost: 1 Abyss | 1 Resilience</i>. That means if this move is part of your current Persona, you can only use it by spending 1 Resilience. It&#39;s not a necessity, though. You can still also use the move by burning an Abyss, whether or not you the required Resilience to spend. <br><br><hr><h2 id="abyss"> The Abyss </h2> Life has a way of accruing woe, especially the way that the characters in Deathless live it. Depravity and affliction pool into a well that fills a person with still, bleak water, glassy in its self-reflection. That accumulation, whether it collects to a pool or a sea, is the Abyss. Call it horror or guilt or sin or anguish, if you want, it&#39;s all the same: the Abyss is weight, fatigue, waiting for its moment to drown someone in it. <br><br> Few understand the Abyss like the players&#39; characters do. Many sense it inside themselves: a perception with presence but no name or shape, try as they might to wrest it into being. A couple even have an instinct for it in others, able to ferret out glimpses through eldritch or accidental methods. But it isn&#39;t until death that one truly faces themselves with unblinking comprehension. That is an experience the deathless alone know. <h3 id="filling_the_abyss"> Filling </h3> You take a point of Abyss under certain, often extereme circumstances. Suffering the loss of your own life, for one. You&#39;re a mortal construct and not designed to comprehend eternity. Not even equipped to process the spasms of bodily failure. Bearing witness to the sensation of a stuttering heartbeat, water-filled lungs, or metal through the belly is meant to occur once in a, well, lifetime. People are not intended to revisit that trauma. It will always leave its mark on you. <br><br> Taking another person&#39;s life will do the same. Unlike dieing, people are sufficiently equipped for killing; to the point of creativity, even. But capability is not comfort. To reach out with intent and violence and snuff a human is to open yourself and invite the ghost of them inside of you. Haunted is the best outcome you can hope for. Pray they don&#39;t try to claw their way out of you again. <br><br> In between living and dieing, all manner of wrongs can have their affect. Rather than detail all the possibilities, the game abides a simple principle: when you participate in, or allow to happen, an act that crosses an unbearable line, take a point of Abyss. Where these lines lie is up to you, the player, at the moment that they happen. Be honest with yourself. The goal isn&#39;t to contrive scenes that causes you to recoil; there is no quota to achieve. Simply, be attentive and aware, and when something crosses a line, make it known. <h3 id="draining_the_abyss"> Draining </h3> Todo: have to rethink what it means to visit and roll against the abyss. <h3 id="burning_the_abyss"> Burning </h3>',29),l9={setup(i){return(n,l)=>(a(),c(y,null,[ZE,s(ro),e9,t9,o9,n9,s9,i9,s(mo),a9],64))}};const A=i=>(G("data-v-3c65d44b"),i=i(),z(),i),h9=A(()=>e("h1",{class:"title",id:"entanglements_page_title"},"Entanglements",-1)),r9=t(" Living is a tangled business.

Any attack on a person is an attempt to Harm them. <br><br> The nuances of <em>Harm</em>, what it means to be harmed and how that affects each character, are intentionally left out of most of the rules. Questions of &quot;how&quot; and &quot;how much&quot; get resolved according to the fiction. A stabbed belly is a stabbed belly. A severed limb is a severed limb. Whatever flows from the moment, however the cause and effect makes sense in the conversation, those properties are most important. <br><br> Characters record the Harm they&#39;ve suffered with <em>Tags</em>: brief statements that describe the damage. Tags are not mechanics themselves. They state the truth of the problem and little more. &quot;Busted jaw&quot;. &quot;Arrow to the knee&quot;. &quot;Gaslit&quot;. The kind and severity of the Harm, and how it impacts the character, gets handled at the moment of its introduction. Whenever it comes up in the fiction afterward the tags help paint a picture of the character living with it. <br><br> The text does hold a few opinions about dealing with Harm. Categorizations more than anything, aids to help you quickly resolve the nature of the problem while the specifics remain in your hands. The rules enforce three concepts: what kind of Harm is it, how severe is it, and how much is too much? <h2 id="insult_and_injury"> Insult and Injury </h2> In Deathless, Harm encompasses more than bodily damage. Vitriol and mind games have equal share in the space. The text will, at times, separate the two categories with the terms <em>Injuries</em> (for bodily effects) and <em>Insults</em> (for emotional or mental damage). Normally, moves only say &quot;Harm&quot;; in these cases you can invoke either category, insult or injury, whichever fits the action. On the rare occasion that either term is specified, the Harm must match that type. <h2 id="pain"> Pain </h2> Harm severity funnels down to two categories, the less severe of which is called <em>Pain</em>. If you have trouble deciding whether the Harm is more or less severe, focus on the intent of the fiction. Is the character trying to send a message or make a statement? That&#39;s Pain. Are they trying to kill or break someone? That&#39;s probably the next step up (see Conditions and Wounds below). <br><br> Player Characters can manage up to three Pain tags at a time. After the third, all Harm escalates to the greater severity independent of the intent. You don&#39;t need to fill out a characters Pain Tags first; skip straight to the greater severity when it makes sense. Also Harm never downgrades from a Wound or Condition to Pain (unless a move specifies otherwise). The character&#39;s situation only ever gets worse. <br><br> Injury and insult may both cause Pain. A character who has been bullied and berated, intimidated and flustered, may not be in physical pain per se, but they&#39;re still in <i>a state</i>. Somewhere beyond clear and conscious control of themselves. That&#39;s what Pain tracks: how the character is pushed towards or across the line where they&#39;re no longer able to think rationally. To the point where they get desperate, take risks and make mistakes, flinch, stumble, or hesitate. The players are not required to act out the state of their pain. Leave those symptoms under the hood if you want. Nonetheless, that&#39;s the position their characters are in. <h2 id="wounds_and_scars"> Wounds and Scars </h2> Player characters have no Harm clock or HP. Each has only a single box to track a <em>Wound</em> tag. Once filled, the next injury causes death. NPCs may not even have that. Some, where it makes sense in the fiction, have a wound slot to fill like the players do. For most: if a PC intends to kill an NPC, they do so. Life in Deathless is not precious. Combat is severe. Murderous intent results in killing. <br><br> Healed wounds beget Scars. You won&#39;t need to remember each and every cut; many of the wounds taken may be forgettable, a patch of mended skin with a story to tell, not much more. For the rest, the missing limbs and digits, the burns and brands, damage to visible areas like the face and hands, those you&#39;ll want to record. A character can list as many scars as they please. The purpose is purely for fictional tracking and does not affect the character&#39;s state of health or capacity to take future Harm. <h2 id="conditions"> Conditions </h2> The mental and emotional versions of a wound, <em>Conditions</em> track things like broken self image, severed attachments, and barely-contained resentment. They affect the character&#39;s behavior at all times, similar to how a wound to affects movement. Every tension near the source, any act which stretches or exercises a connection to it, all strain from the damage. <br><br> Mechanically, Conditions manifest as penalties to player rolls. Each of the characters&#39; stats have two slots for Conditions. For each condition on a stat, the character takes -1 when they roll it. This modifier remains as long as the Condition persists. <br><br> A note on severity: the important difference between Pains and Conditions is not always the toxicity of the attack, but instead the persistence of the result. Pains disappear in short order, Conditions do not. We don&#39;t always get a say in what greives or affronts us. Sometimes, the insignificant shit you hold on, the emotinal pricks that still hurt despite all the opportunity to heal, that&#39;ll surprise you. Keep that in mind when Conditions come into play: the lingering effects can be disproportionate compared to their source. <h2> Healing </h2> Wounds can mend with care: time, restraint, patience. All the <em>things the characters won&#39;t have</em> in surplus. In a rush you&#39;ll do what any desperate fool would do: go to one of those things that call themselves doctors, or find a pharmacist who&#39;ll pack the sores full of herbs, maybe stitch pieces back together yourself. Or you die. Funny thing about dieing when you&#39;re in the character&#39;s position: all your injuries get healed up in the process. <br><br> Conditions, unlike wounds, won&#39;t even mend with time or rest. To heal a damaged mind you&#39;ll need to engage with the emotions directly. Each stat has different specifics for engagement, but they all invoke one of two behaviors: you can fight back against the feeling (<em>Catharsis</em>), or give in to it (<em>Surrender</em>). Or, your Persona might provide an alternative, a way to put that hurt into motion independent of the stat. <br><br> Play a Condition into the fiction according to the requirements of a removal trigger (such as Catharsis or Surrender) and, when the scene is over, you get to erase that Condition. Triggering Condition removal is expected to be an <i>event</i>, not mere background noise or an offhand gesture. If the scene didn&#39;t include the introduction of a new character, new clock, or a significant change in the relationship with an existing character, the insitgating player didn&#39;t take it far enough to count as a resolution trigger. Because of this weight, each character can only resolve a single condition per scene, even if they meet multiple resolution triggers. <br><br><table class="tbl"><thead class="tblHead"><tr class="tblRow"><th class="tblEnt"></th><th class="tblEnt">Catharsis</th><th class="tblEnt">Surrendur</th></tr></thead><tbody class="tblBody"><tr class="tblRow"><td class="tblEnt"><em>Glamour</em></td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Win someone&#39;s affection then drop them, just to prove you can.</td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Distance yourself from someone who trusts or cares about you.</td></tr><tr class="tblRow"><td class="tblEnt"><em>Insight</em></td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Abandon a prior arrangement or solution to do things your way.</td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Put yourself in a bad spot without taking prior precautions.</td></tr><tr class="tblRow"><td class="tblEnt"><em>Resolve</em></td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Don&#39;t back out of a hopeless situation, or stay when everyone else flees.</td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Indulge in gratification or vice at significant expense.</td></tr><tr class="tblRow"><td class="tblEnt"><em>Force</em></td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Start an unnecessary fight or escalate a tense situation.</td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Show submission to someone who challenges you.</td></tr><tr class="tblRow"><td class="tblEnt"><em>Skill</em></td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Challenge a formidable opponent to a contest and go to any lengths to win.</td><td class="tblEnt">\u21C0 Challenge an easy opponent to a contest and try to ruin them in the process.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="defenses"> Defenses </h2> Protecting against Harm is, for the most part, <em>handled in the fiction</em>, not in the mechanics. Shields don&#39;t have a value, armor can&#39;t take a wound and downgrade it to pain. The table must question whether, in the presence of sufficient defenses, a character can deal Harm at all; not how much it might get reduced. <br><br> Naturally, that leads into ambiguity. If an NPC has a shield, can you Harm them or not? The shield is there, it exists in the fiction, but it isn&#39;t the perfect defense either. Easiest way to handle this is to assume the NPC will use their shield, or whatever it is they have to defend themselves with, and probably <i>successfully</i>, unless the players&#39; characters deal with it in some way. By taking it from them, or causing a distraction, or using an attack that a shield can&#39;t block. It doesn&#39;t particularly matter how: be creative. <br><br> Now, what if a player character has a shield, what then? The MC still has the right to <em>Harm them</em>. That&#39;s one of their moves, and it isn&#39;t dependent on the PC&#39;s lack of defenses. Kinda begs the question: what good is a shield? It&#39;s a bargaining chip. Something you can offer when you need to make sacrifices. <br><br> There is one part to defense that doesn&#39;t require fictional handling, a currency that can be traded for protection regardless of the character&#39;s position: (link-needed)<b>Resilience</b>. When a PC would receive a Condition, they can instead spend a Resilience to ignore the Harm. Fictionally, this is the character exhausting some sense of security or lingering good feelings to ward off the Condition. Still a sacrifice, in its own way, just more formalized. <h2 id="sacrifices"> Sacrifices </h2> Characters in Deathless don&#39;t fuck with danger and come out clean. One of the MCs principles is, after all, <i><em>give nothing away freely</em></i>- and gambling is not payment. When a character takes risks, when they throw themselves against bad odds or imminent danger, losses are expected. Sure they might scrape by on a roll or two, eventually they&#39;re going to get hurt, and when they do they get to make a choice: take the Harm, or sacrifice something valuable to keep themselves in the scene. <br><br>',94),R9={class:"squeeze"},H9=D('<br> If you go looking for an alternative move, some check to see if you can keep your shit together or slip sideways around the problem, you won&#39;t find one. The players don&#39;t get to throw their characters in over their heads and just hope for the best. The MC doesn&#39;t get to throw danger at the players and just hope for the best. The risk is always real, and to get through everyone needs to approach it head on or trade for a character&#39;s safety. <h2 id="negotiating_harm"> Negotiating Harm </h2> Most of the time the game handles negotiations for you. First you let the moves have their say (you want to pull a stunt? okay, roll the move and watch the dice). If the roll goes well then everyone gets on with the scene. When it tanks, you look at the rules on Harm, figure out which ones match the fiction and deal with the aftermath according to those rules. Then, everyone gets on with the scene. Great and good. <br><br> What happens if <em>the table can&#39;t decide</em> what move (if any) you&#39;re able to trigger? A soldier has you at spearpoint, can you Overwhelm them without first getting stabbed? You&#39;re abandoned in a cell, do you just suffer the maddening isolation, or can you thwart it somehow? On your knees before the chopping block in the city center, in view of a bloodthirsty crowd, the sheriff lashes accusations against you and your ken; the abuses of this turncoat bastard churn your stomach, but is there anything at all you can roll to avoid taking another Condition? <br><br> Of course, at your table, you get to make these decisions however you want: hack and bend the game this way and that. But the foundation of the game, the advice it gives the MC, the reason it makes you offer Sacrifices instead of a roll to gamble through the risk, is that you are not always in control of the moment. The players&#39; characters do not have the power to choose what does and doesn&#39;t hurt them, or what danger they can and cannot ignore. No negotiations: you&#39;ll take a spear to the chest, scream into the lonely dark, and reek of vengence and impotence tomorrow. <h2 id="npc_harm"> NPC Harm </h2> Non-playable characters, the lot controlled by the MC, don&#39;t track all this structure like the players&#39; characters do. Instead, their Harm is defined more simply defined by their fictional position. An NPC is either in Pain, or they aren&#39;t. Pissed off or thinking clearly. Wounded or healthy. Dead, or alive. Their state switches <em>as the fiction dictates</em>, with each affliction giving the NPC a new Tag. They might take &quot;kicked in the ribs&quot; to track how they&#39;re in Pain, or &quot;one-upped by Flynn&quot; if they&#39;re in a mood. The MC can add as many Tags as they want a character to have. <br><br> What&#39;s important is how each Tag changes that character&#39;s behavior. &quot;One-upped by Flynn&quot; isn&#39;t an idle frustration; it means that character is a spring coiled tight with contempt, or is cowed when in the same room together. &quot;Kicked in the ribs&quot; will cause them to double over, breathe laboriously through their teeth and strain to make each movement. Tags are burdens, and the table should see the character struggle to heft their weight. <h2 id="dealing_harm"> Dealing Harm </h2> Always <em>lead with the fiction</em>. Ideally, the player starts with a description of what their character is trying to do, and how they mean to achieve it. It&#39;s fine to start with your instincts, too. You can say, &quot;I&#39;m going to kick this little cretin&#39;s teeth in,&quot; without meaning you want to literally kick their teeth. But when it comes time to act on your instinct, four things should be clearly addressed in the conversation: which character(s) the Harm is directed at, whether you&#39;re dealing Insult or Injury, if you&#39;re holding back to only cause Pain, and what it looks like when your character does it. <br><br> At this point the MC will say if you trigger a move (probably (link-needed)<b>Overwhlem</b> or (link-needed)<b>Snipe</b>, if it&#39;s a basic move) or not. A move only triggers under two circumstances: either you need the mmove to do whatevver you did in the first place; or you&#39;re uncertain about the outcome. Not all Harm is uncertain. Sometimes you simply do it (&quot;I stab the sleeping Baron&quot;). Sometimes it&#39;s impossible (&quot;I stab the suit of living iron&quot;). <br><br> If you thought you had triggered a certain move and the MC didn&#39;t call it, or they called a different move, it&#39;s a good idea to pause and make sure everyone has the same perspective on what the fiction looks like in the moment. Chances are the MC pictured the action or the intent a little differently than you did.

"),eM=e("br",null,null,-1),tM=e("hr",null,null,-1),oM=e("h2",{id:"pbta_principles"}," PBTA Principles ",-1),nM=D('<br> Many of your principles are common throughout the various PBTA games. The wording may change a little here or there, but the underlying advice remains similar throughout. The suggestions here will help maintain the general approach to play in a way that helps not only the game succeed at large, but sets you up to focus on the moves and principles specifically tailored to Deathless. <h4 id="the_fiction"> \u21C0 Begin and end with the fiction </h4> All actions in the game should be grounded in the fiction, even when the rules are involved. Moves aren&#39;t invoked directly. Players should describe the things their character does in the fiction, and that fiction then triggers one of their moves. If Sara says, &quot;I want to Harm them, so I guess that&#39;s an Overwhelm?&quot;, take a moment to pause and discuss how that happens. Does her character attack with a weapon? Are they verbally dressing someone down? What exactly does she say or do to trigger Overwhelm? These details are important to help everyone at the table create a mental picture of how the moment plays out. They&#39;ll also help you understand what happens to Sara&#39;s character afterward, what position they end up in and, if you have the opportunity to make a move, how you can leverage that position in your reaction. <br><br> Likewise, the outcome should also occur in the fiction. If Sara&#39;s character slashes an opponent with their knife, the result must be more than &quot;your opponent takes 1 Harm&quot;. Someone just got cut the fuck up. Where were they hit? How badly? How do they respond, assuming they&#39;re still alive? Any action that instigates fictional change must result in fictional aftermath. <br><br> You&#39;re bound to this principle as much as the players. When you use one of your own moves, make it happen in the fiction. Disguise the consequence in a way that flows naturally from the current moment. Don&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m going to destroy your resources&quot;, when you can say, &quot;the paper in your cart has caught fire, one of the stray embers must have fallen inside&quot;. Instead of, &quot;I&#39;m turning your safety into danger&quot;, say, &quot;Bogan left to take a piss ten minutes ago, and he still hasn&#39;t come back. Something is up.&quot; <h4 id="address_characters"> \u21C0 Address the characters before the players </h4> To keep the conversation directed at the fiction, address the players as their characters, not as people in control of characters. When you ask a player what their character does, you&#39;re having a conversation about some separate fictional event, and creating a story by proxy. When you say the character&#39;s name and ask what they do, the resulting conversation becomes the fiction, and is the story itself. <br><br> Inversely, when you need to talk about things outside of the fiction- to address safety concerns, check in with the group, or whatever else- you have a clear divide between fiction and reality. Address the players at this time, not the characters. <h4 id="ask_questions"> \u21C0 Ask dangerous questions and wield the answers </h4> Because you, like the players, are playing to find out what happens, you can&#39;t be expected to know everything about the fiction surrounding you. Be curious, and be a fan of what your players might have ideas for. Ask them what they think of the situation, about themselves and each other. Ask them what they&#39;re scared might happen. Be bold and ask about topics beyond their own character: why is the world this way? What do the people here think of their rulers? What name do the people here pray to, and is that psychopomp alive? And, of course, always ask them, &quot;what do you do?&quot; <br><br> Once you have your answers, wield them. Change the world. Manifest adversaries and interference. Bring those answers to life in small and large ways both. The players may not control the world like you do, but by planting the seeds of their ideas you encrich the fiction in ways that everyone cares about. And when everyone cares about the fiction, they&#39;ve given it teeth to bite back at them. <h4 id="give_info"> \u21C0 Give the players information freely and honestly </h4> All roleplay deals with the control of knowledge in some form or another, but remember your agenda: play to find out what happens, not play to trickle information down to the players. Duplicity and secrets are at odds with the nature of the converation, and tend to sow contention between the players and MC. Trust your players to handle an open flow of information. Help them be are aware of, and buy into, the dramatic irony of the situation. <h4 id="think_offscreen"> \u21C0 Think offscreen, too </h4> The actions and reactions of the world mustn&#39;t always occur in the immediate space around the players&#39; characters. The world lives and breathes even when it isn&#39;t observed. What are people scheming in the background? How do they maneuver their advantage? Things are constantly changing behind the characters&#39; backs. Don&#39;t be afraid to make changes offscreen while the characters act successfully onscreen. <br><hr><h2 id="deathless_principles"> Deathless&#39; Principles </h2>',27),sM=D('<br> These principles, in contrast to the prior set, are specific to the tone and atmosphere of this game, independent of other pbta titles. Their purpose is to help funnel you towards your agenda, to help you portray a hungry world, barbed hooks, and real people. <h4 id="spin_webs"> \u21C0 Spin webs, leave threads unattached </h4> Every character has some connection to another, but you won&#39;t always know whom strings lead to. It&#39;s important to leave space for the unknown. The more your players engage with a character and their relationships, the more opportunity these connections have to attach to someone. <br><br> Lean on your players. Let them imagine how the characters relate, and how they&#39;re caught up in the web of things. Engage with the table to establish those connections, even if in subtle ways (&quot;Do you think this soldier reports directly to the captain?&quot;, &quot;Would Crim gossip about these details to the Consul&#39;s eyes and ears?&quot;). That will build relationships in the open, in a way that everyone can follow along with and buy in to. <h4 id="strife_and_relief"> \u21C0 Fill the story with frequent strife and transient relief </h4> The conversation needs to have a certain rhythm and pace. Most times it should be engaged and dangrous, loaded with tension between characters, probably some action, and paved with choices that leave their marks on people. <br><br> Every now and then it also needs breathing room. Partly for contrast. In part for decompression. Don&#39;t equate relief to idleness; you get to be idle when the table takes a break. Moments of relief should indulge some part of the players&#39; or their characters&#39; needs: give them joy or gratitude, encourage them to reflect on their behavior, let them <i>Enjoy Respite</i> and make connections with other characters. Just as the frequent strife should actively increase the tension, the downtime between must relieve it. <h4 id="misfortune"> \u21C0 Deal in costly decisions, misfortune, and trouble that always comes looking </h4> The characters do not lead simple, easygoing lives. They are exceptional people making their way through exceptional circumstances. You, as the arbiter of these circumstances, are to ensure that every corner they turn reveals new drama. Hardship and upset are their bread and butter of living. At every opportunity, every time the players look to you and ask, &quot;what now?&quot;, turn to this principle. <h4 id="no_freebies"> \u21C0 Give nothing away freely </h4> Friends, alliances, opportunities, safety, information, love, power, followers, attention, support, success; nothing in this world is handed to the players. If they want it, the characters either need to pay, to work for it, or to take it despite resistance. <h4 id="deadliness"> \u21C0 Make fraught situations deadly </h4> Make characters die. Player characters, your npcs, it doesn&#39;t matter. The preservation of life is not your goal. Let your darlings get killed. Kill them off, if you have to. Whatever you do, never pull your punches, and don&#39;t let the playes&#39; pull theirs either. If one character moves with the intent to kill, then another character dies. <h4 id="unnatural_humanity"> \u21C0 Use the unnatural to talk about the human </h4> Deathless is invested in humanity, in the human condition. It should not exclude the fantastic. In fact, I encourage you to include supernatural elements: monsters, magic, demons, gods and the like. The line that divides, the line that shouldn&#39;t be crossed, is where the unnatural itself becomes what&#39;s interesting about the story. Wizardry is not about magic, it is about the pursuit of invention where terrible means justify impressive ends. Always loop back to people. The people affected, the people involved, and the people who turn a blind eye so long as they benefit by the results. <h4 id="pursue_accountability"> \u21C0 Pursue accountability for the actions commmitted </h4> No action occurs in a vacuum. Every person is connected to other people. Every object has meaning to someone. Whether good or ill, the players&#39; actions have consequences. The results ripple out to affect others. Maybe sometimes the outcome goes unaddressed, but you should always look for the chance to involve the consequences for past choices. If the characters did good, seek to reward them (this ties in to <i>Give nothing away freely</i>); and on the contrary, don&#39;t let bad behavior go unpunished. <h4 id="manipulate_loyalties"> \u21C0 Manipulate loyalties or turn them against each other </h4> Don&#39;t fear allowing your (figurative) paladin to turn on the rogue, now and then. If the PCs all have to play nice and get along with each other, you&#39;ll never discover where they draw their lines, or how much they need to be pressed before they&#39;re willing to cross over. Deathless wants and expects contention among PCs. Let NPCs coerce and divide the party. See if you can bind them into conflicting allegiances. Give your players motivations that contrast one another. If you can pit them against each other, you can find ways to bring them together again afterward, too. <br><hr><h2 id="mc_moves"> MC Moves </h2> While the players and MC both have moves, yours work in a very different way than theirs. You never roll, and your moves never fail. When you say that something happens, it happens. And whatever that is, it happens in the fiction. This is part of beginning and ending in the fiction. You are allowed to make statements that are fictionally true, so long as they are backed by a move. <br><br> Although your moves describe what you&#39;re allowed to do, they do so in broad strokes and intentionally leave much to the imagination. They&#39;re not not solely for retaliating or punishing the players. View them, fundamentally, as tools to keep the story interesting and tense. Sometimes, yes, you&#39;ll use them as a response to a missed roll. Other times it&#39;s just to prod a stalled conversation or tweak the urgency of the moment. <br><h3 id="moves_when"> When To Make Moves </h3><h4 id="after_a_move"> \u21C0 After a player move allows it </h4> Most player moves in the game will describe what to do on a Successful or Partially successful roll, but won&#39;t say what to do on a Miss. Other times the move will state that you get to make a move in addition to the other outcomes. In both cases you are allowed to make a move &quot;as hard as you want&quot;. As hard as you want doesn&#39;t need to mean you assign the maximum punishment to the character, although you are allowed to do so. It means your move can affect them as directly or indirectly as you please. <br><br> On the topic of directness, Deathless functions best when characters fail forward. That is, a Missed move doesn&#39;t need to prevent them from achieving their goals, especially since that often kills the scene&#39;s the momentum. In most situations it is better to let the character succeed and then come at them sideways with a new problem. <h4 id="what_next"> \u21C0 When anyone looks at you to see what happens next </h4> Anytime the players aren&#39;t moving the scene forward on their own, they&#39;re probably looking at you to do it for them. Maybe this is because the conversation stalled. Maybe something new is in the scene and they aren&#39;t sure how to approach it. Maybe, most simply, they just made their own move and are curious to see what happens next. Whatever the cause, this is your opportunity to push things in a certain direction, to set up new tension and danger, and keep the scene moving forward. <h4 id="golden_opportunity"> \u21C0 If given a golden opportunity </h4> A golden opportunity happens when the players leave a previous event unaddressed. If you put danger or opposition in the scene, and the players don&#39;t do anything about it, you now have a golden opportunity to follow through on that setup. <h3 id="after_a_move"> After Making A Move </h3> Once you&#39;ve made a move, always ask the players, &quot;what do you do?&quot; This is the most essential part of the conversation. Your moves are your way of abiding your principles and fulfilling your agenda. The players have their own agenda, and must get their own opportunity to act. <h3 id="moves"> Moves </h3>',49),iM=D('<h4 id="reveal_truth"> \u21C0 Reveal an unwelcome truth </h4> This is your standard move for stepping things up a notch. The truth can be distant and informational (your contact across town was murdered yesterday), or close by and intimate (Beth is trying to stab you). It&#39;s your way to let the players know just how bad of a spot they&#39;re in now, or are about to be in- ratcheting up the tension of the moment- while still giving the players all the opportunities to react. <h4 id="turn_safety"> \u21C0 Turn safety to danger </h4> Expose their hideout. Separate the group. Show the flaws in their equipment. Whatever it is they have to help them feel safe and secure, strike at it. Make them vulnerable, and aware of it. <h4 id="cause_trouble"> \u21C0 Make their move cause more trouble than it solves </h4> If a player misses and you aren&#39;t sure how to turn the moment around against them, then don&#39;t turn it around. Run with it. Let them succeed and cause havoc in the doing. <h4 id="harm_them"> \u21C0 Harm them </h4> The most standard of all retaliations: attack the character. Harm encompasses all manner of insult and injury. You can cause pain, if you simply want to send a message. Or you can inflict Conditions and Wounds. Keep in mind that you should <i>make fraught situations deadly</i>. The PCs can&#39;t die, after all. You never need to worry about doing too much Harm. <h4 id="remind_them"> \u21C0 Remind them of their place in the world </h4> Whether your game postures the PCs as mundane or important, loved or loathed, all the people in the world have an opinion of them. Sometimes they have direct opinions about the individual characters, borne of prior interaction or reputation. Other times its an opionion about what they are: deathless, humanity undying and unbounded. Whatever the sentement may be, show it. Remind them of the differences that set them apart from others, and of peoples inclination to carry strong opinions about such differences. <h4 id="compel_them"> \u21C0 Compel someone to complicate the situation </h4> Every character, PCs and NPCs alike, have compulsions which they find difficult to resist. These might apply broadly, like yearnings for lucre or the instinct to fight over any insult. They may be specific: the unwillingness to tell a certain person no; or to protect a ward from everything, even the joys of life. Call out those tendencies. Dangle these temptations and seduce characters into trouble and complication. <h4 id="claim_resources"> \u21C0 Claim their resources </h4> Coin, equipment, supplies, leverage, help, secrets, contacts. Whatever they have, especially the things they need, can be taken from them. Destroy it if you want, or make them work to get it back. <h4 id="tug_at_entanglements"> \u21C0 Tug at the strings of Entanglements </h4> Entanglements give you pawns to move around, to place into danger or in positions of power. Though, this change doesn&#39;t always need to involve risk or power dynamics. Another way to twist the relationship is to change how the characters percieve one another. Color the players instincts with conflicting motivations. Make the people they&#39;re saving do wrong, or make grudges useful or valuable. Turn it around and inform the npcs of the PCs troublemaking and misdeeds. <h4 id="advance_antagonism"> \u21C0 Advance an antagonist&#39;s position, on or offscreen </h4> Sometimes the most simple move to make is to give your antagonists a better position. Do this when you&#39;re <i>thinking offscreen</i>, too. Imagine how the world is moving to position itself against the players. Keeping the pieces in the background in mind can be especially useful when you&#39;re stumped on how to respond to a player&#39;s move in the moment. Let them succeed, and then kick something offscreen into action. <br><br> Importantly, this is not the same thing as &quot;figuring it out later&quot;. The fiction needs to change now, not down the road. But the effets don&#39;t need to come down on the player immediately, either. Start a new clock. Tell the players which pieces are moving and where. Or, at the very least, describe someone who is or will be taking interest in them, and why. <h4 id="opportunity"> \u21C0 Offer an opportunity </h4> The most simple move is the last one: give the characters something they can do. Remember to <i>give nothing away freely</i>. But do give to the players, at least as much as you take. Give them ways to engage. Give them challenges to overcome and characters to meet. Give them invitations to be excited about the conversation. Give them the spotlight. Give them rewards, even. Sometimes, when you&#39;re trying to <i>fill the story with transient relief</i>, relief can be the opportunity and engagement the cost. <br><hr><h2 id="general_advice"> General Advice </h2><h3 id="scenes"> Scenes </h3> todo. <h3 id="spotlights"> Spotlights </h3> I&#39;ll get around to it, I promise.

You will engage with cruelty and viciousness. At this point you&#39;ve (hopefully) read the agendas and recognized the tone I&#39;m trying to set. Whether you have or not, it bears repeating: Deathless is about difficult topics. The players should, if the MC follows their principles, find themselves pressed into situations they don&#39;t want to be in. The MC should, if the players engage with the mechanics, be something blah blah stepping stones. In order to allow that to happen, you must trust the other people at the table, and feel safe to tell this story together with them. <br><br> Trust and safety are not a switch that can be toggled. The nature of role playing, improvisation, and inhabiting another character means we all, at times, find ourselves in territory that we did not, despite intentions, expect to enter. We may say, do, and feel things that we didn&#39;t think we ever would. We can surprise ourselves to find that a line was crossed, especially when we were the one to cross it. These revelations can, when handled appropriately and in the correct environment, encourage valuable discussion and introspection. Outside of that environment we risk hurting each other, and that is never the goal. <br><br> Finally, please keep in mind that you, the individual, are in charge of your well-being and safety. The game can hand you the tools, but it will not use them for you. Open communication with your fellow players is your responsibility. Using the tools to communicate your feelings is your responsibility. Respecting and supporting your fellow players when they use the tools is your responsibility. The tools below are a minimal recommendation for maintaining safety and trust at your table. If you have additional tools you&#39;d like to use, you are welcome and encouraged to incorporate them. <h2>Before</h2> Before means both &quot;before you decide to play this game&quot; and also &quot;before each session that you play&quot;. Likewise, it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;only before, and no other time&quot;. You can come back and revisit these any time you need. But at minimum, make sure you review them before you play. <h4>CATS</h4> Everyone should be able to agree on the following: Concept, Aim, Tone, and Subject matter. Make sure there is consensus at the table about what you&#39;re playing and where it&#39;s taking you. <br> Further reading:\xA0<a href="https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/12/CATS.html">CATS by Patrick O&#39;Leary</a><h4>Lines and Veils</h4> A line expresses a hard limit, a boundary dividing what may and may not appear in the game. A veil describes concepts that are allowed, but that shouldn&#39;t be visited in detail. Players may declare these publically, or they may share them in private with the MC. Either way, in the end, everyone at the table should have access to the lines and veils in use. <br> Further reading:\xA0<a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean">Lines and Veils on RPGStackExchange</a><h2>During</h2><h4 class="noTopMargin">X Card</h4> Depending on your circumstance the X may be a physical card which players can reach out and touch, or it may be the act of saying, typing, or showing an X. A player may tap the X card any time that they are uncomfortable with the current scene. Once tapped, the scene either changes course or cuts to somewhere else. No questions asked, no explanations needed. <br> Further reading:\xA0<a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg">X-Card by John Stavropoulos</a><h4>Support Flower</h4> The support flower is similar to the X card, but more nuanced in execution. It allows for participants to request that the scene stop (red), but also for it to slow down or proceed with caution (yellow). It also allows participants to ask for more, or to dig in deeper (green) when they like where the scene is headed. <br> Further reading:\xA0<a href="https://the-act-apart.itch.io/the-support-flower">Support Flower by the Act Apart</a><h4>Open Door Policy</h4> Participation in the game is not required. Anyone may leave or disconnect for any reason, without fear of judgement from others. <h2>After</h2><h4 class="noTopMargin">Debriefs</h4> Everyone at the table should have an opportunity to check in with each other and address feelings. This can be done in private between participants, or with the group as a whole. It isn&#39;t necessary to wait for the end of the session to debrief. Taking breaks in-between scenes, especially to follow up after an emotionally charged moment, is a great time to administer aftercare. <br><br> Other tools can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZCj">TTRPG Safety Toolkit</a>.

Each one represents a penchant for solving problems with a particular approach; best read as answers to the question, &quot;when under duress, how does this character successfully navigate through a situation?&quot; <br><br> For example, Force applies equally to brutish attacks as to commanding leadership. In both cases the character uses a display of power to get what they want. <h3>Glamour</h3> Define the impression someone has of you and lure others towards your needs. Make something seem like that which it is not. <h3>Insight</h3> Observe the moment, pierce the surface and look beneath, or imagine how the details string together. Address what is, and not what seems to be. <h3>Resolve</h3> Weather a storm with dignity, find gems in the waste, and maintain self control. Put ideals in front of the situation. <h3>Force</h3> Make yourself the center of attention, apply unyielding pressure, and put adversity under your heel. Break any obstacle in your path. <h3>Skill</h3> Showcase your expertise, produce intricacy and grace at ease, or work within the constraints. Do exactly what the moment needs, no more and no less. <br><br><hr><h2>The Abyss</h2> The bottomless sea existed before all things, and awaits the end of all things. <br> The endlessness is within and between all things. <br> All comes from the Abyss, and all returns to the Abyss. <br><br> In addition to the earlier five stats, all characters have an Abyss track that sometimes acts as their sixth stat. Unlike the other five it doesn&#39;t showcase an approach they take to problem solving. A character cannot behave <i>abyssally</i>. Rather, this track represents the characters&#39; loss of self, their erosion to the connection in the world. <br><br> holy shit I just realized what the game needs to be about, and it is NOT the abyss. It&#39;s about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrEayPIrVE . You do terrible things, sure. And you don&#39;t have to feel bad about it, because you live forever. So how do you make the game about dealing with it? Loss and connection, instead of the abyss, is essential. Fighting against your nature and the sins you are compelled to do is essential. But these are all generators. How do you atone for yourself? How do you investigate atonement? <br><br> To say &quot;the more abyss you have the more powerful you are&quot; inverts the theme of the game, I think. Want power? Keep on sinning to get more? That&#39;s like saying, &quot;sin is good, keep on doing it&quot;. Urban shadows avoids this by having the corruption track &#39;kill&#39; you at its fulfillment. Corruption there is not about loss of humanity, it&#39;s about a turn of humanity towards a specific end. The abyss, &quot;all I need to do to absolve my sin is make connections with people&quot; isn&#39;t the right vector. So... how to have both a growth of power to use the personas (and do I drop shared skills to do that?) without mechanizing, &quot;regret nothing and reap the rewards&quot;? <br><br> keep the theme in mind. &quot;if this were a video game, you&#39;d have no introspection for the small stuff. here you must. Feel your humanity slipping away at each step.&quot; <br><br> The players&#39; characters in deathless have a unique relationship with the Abyss. <br><br> You should be no different, yet you are different. When you die, like all other things, your consciousness returns to the Abyss. Unlike other things, it gets pulled back out again. The process isn\u2019t easy or clean: the Abyss doesn\u2019t expect you to go, it doesn\u2019t want you to go; you belong to it again, and so it will claw and bite and tear and drag as much of you as it can grasp back underneath its waters. Therefore, when you do return to life, you come back with a little less of yourself. <br><br> Death will rip out a bit more of you each time, until one day you look inward and find only a cavernous and empty void. On that day others might see something return to your body, but it\u2019s too little of you to really be you. When that happens you will be gone, lost and drowned in the void. But you can prevent this fate. You can replace what the Abyss consumes. While the sea is deep and still and endless, the lives of people are turbulent, tangled, and finite. Bind yourself into the knots of their wants and woes so that when the Abyss takes you under, those ties hold you together and fish you back out again. <br></div><br><hr>',4),$W={setup(i){return(n,l)=>(a(),c(y,null,[vW,s(fo,{embedded:""})],64))}};const kW=["onKeyup"],TW={class:"glossaryList__search"},xW={class:"glossaryList__entries"},IW=["onClick"],CW={class:"entry__type"},AW={setup(i){const n=se(),l=ie();let r=0,f=0,g=0;const b=v=>{!matchMedia("screen and (max-width: 900px)").matches||(r=v.targetTouches[0].screenX,f=v.targetTouches[0].screenY,g=v.timeStamp)},w=v=>{if(!matchMedia("screen and (max-width: 900px)").matches)return;const S=v.changedTouches[0].screenX-r,W=v.changedTouches[0].screenY-f,B=v.timeStamp-g;r=0,f=0,g=0,S<-100&&-50<W&&W<50&&B<1e3&&N(),S>100&&-50<W&&W<50&&B<1e3&&U()},k=O(null),E=O(null),M=O(null);let H=O(!0);const U=()=>{H.value=!0,M.value.focus()},N=()=>{const v=M.value;v&&v.blur(),H.value=matchMedia("screen and (min-width: 900px)").matches},K=()=>{!H.value||N()};O("");const x=[];$E.forEach(v=>{const S=Object.assign({},v);S.searchable=[S.name,S.type,...S.tags].map(W=>W.toLowerCase()),x.push(S)}),x.sort((v,S)=>v.name.localeCompare(S.name));const Y=O(Object.assign({},x)),Z=v=>{let S=v.target.value?v.target.value.toLowerCase().trim():"";if(!S){Y.value=Object.assign({},x);return}Y.value=x.filter(W=>W.searchable.some(B=>B.includes(S)))},ne=v=>{l.push({path:`/glossary${v.path}`}),N()};return ae(()=>{x.some(v=>n.path.includes(v.path))&&(H.value=!1),k.value.addEventListener("touchstart",b,!1),k.value.addEventListener("touchend",w,!1),E.value.addEventListener("touchstart",b,!1),E.value.addEventListener("touchend",w,!1),n.path.includes("landing")&&(matchMedia("screen and (max-width: 900px)").matches?H.value=!1:M.value.focus()),le("navOpen",K)}),me(()=>{document.removeEventListener("click",K),le("navOpen",K)}),(v,S)=>{const W=F("router-view");return a(),c(y,null,[e("div",{class:C({glossaryList:!0,"glossaryList--slideout":Q(H)}),onKeyup:To(N,["esc"]),ref_key:"slideout",ref:E,tabglossary:"-1"},[e("div",TW,[e("input",{type:"text",ref_key:"searchInput",ref:M,class:"glossaryList__search__input",placeholder:"search for moves/playbooks/etc",onInput:Z},null,544)]),e("div",xW,[e("ul",null,[(a(!0),c(y,null,J(Y.value,B=>(a(),c("li",{key:B,class:C({entry:!0,"entry--selected":v.$route.path.includes(B.path)}),onClick:ee(b5=>ne(B),["stop"])},[e("div",null,_(B.name),1),e("div",CW,_(B.type),1)],10,IW))),128))])])],42,kW),e("div",{class:"glossary",ref_key:"page",ref:k},[s(W)],512)],64)}}};var SW=I(AW,[["__scopeId","data-v-1a7bb375"]]);const PW={},EW=i=>(G("data-v-6d395690"),i=i(),z(),i),MW={class:"glossaryHome"},WW=t(" Welcome to the glossary.
