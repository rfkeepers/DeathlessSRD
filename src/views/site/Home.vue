    Do you ever think about what happens afterward?

<div class="fancy">
    Everyone dies, you suppose.  Nothing special about that.  Your way was just as ordinary as anyones'.  An accident at work.  Earlier in life than you expected.  Timing is usually the only remarkable part.

<div class="fancy">
    And then you came back.  Lucky, lucky you.  Oh, but you thought they'd have been happy to see you again.  Why wouldn't they?  Back to life!  Not dead at all!  Back to hold your little girl.  Back to care for your spouse and your home.  Back, again, to make it all go right this time, you swear it.  You swear on whatever gave you a second chance that your daughter will never stare at another empty plate for dinner.  You'll never get indebted to another shark.  Never again will anyone cry over what you haven't done... or what you have.

    plague on it.  Doesn’t matter much now that you’re back.  Back and shunned by all.  Hauled out of your own home by your friends and neighbors, with not even the decency to turn your child’s face away as they dragged your heels down the street, threw you from town and told you to never return.  You knew it would go that way.  As a child you listened to stories about the deathless, how they sneak into town at night to eat unruly infants and infect the good nature of a town, about the exorcisms to perform when someone crawls back out of a grave.  You could’ve just stayed away. -->

    ut could you have stayed away, really?  You’re no monster, no horror.  It’s just you.  Tired without sleep, hungry without food, bleeding when cut, joyous and relieved to open the door and see your hearth and home… every bit like it used to be.  Why shouldn’t you get to come home again and embrace your child and sup with your family and sleep in your bed?  Stories be damned, they should have welcomed you back with joy!  Not dead after all, right as can be, aren’t we all lucky!?  They could have given you a chance.
