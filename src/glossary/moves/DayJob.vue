        Honestly, I don't have much love for this move.  If I recall, it came from the space in design where I was still taking a hatchet to what the game was <i>about</i>, chunk by chunk whittling it down to where we are now.  And part of that process was trying on different hats, like, "what if there's some monster hunting" or dungeon delving, or some other thing where the players might want to derive valuables from their kills.  That... isn't really the game any longer.  So this move should probably be on the chopping block, too.
