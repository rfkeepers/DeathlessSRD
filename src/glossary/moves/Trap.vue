        Similar to Expert Guide's question about what, exactly, can qualify as a trap for one to walk into, this move also has some wiggle room about what constitutes a trap that can be laid.  I imagine that most players will view it like I had when writing the move: a physical trap with physical containment.  But I suppose I wouldn't be bothered if a table managed to use it in a less specific format.
