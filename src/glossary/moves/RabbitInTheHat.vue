        Another experiment in turning a magic trick into a move.  This one isn't as elegant as And For My Next Move.  It has more built in complication just in terms of figuring out the results.  On one hand I do like what the move is reaching for.  On the other hand, I don't want to stall the table over contrivances around it, such as what you pulled and who would suspect you and etc turning into a discussion that sidelines the game itself.
