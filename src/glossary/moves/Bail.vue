        Among pbta staples that I like, but have conflicted feelings about when it comes to widespread availability (ie: basic move status), is the 'escape a spot' move.  The tug-of-war is whether frequency of usage must drive availability.  Personally, as the writer of these things, they're tastier when I place them within a specific thematic flavor, than without.  But that also means that I've deprived the game of a useful tool that it might be worse off without.
