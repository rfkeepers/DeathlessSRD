        For nearly the entirety of the games lifespan I didn't have a basic move for reading a situation (in terms of the place you're in).  I decided to keep that sort of knowledge here relegated to the grifter.  I'm still happy with that choice, and I think in the end helped me find the space for the current basic move, which I like more.
