        <h2>The Game</h2>
        Deathless is a game about flawed and troublesome characters who are never allowed to die.  A person without the fear of death is a person without fear.  At the table, we play to find out where those characters' lines are drawn: which boundaries do they preserve, and which are they willing to step across?
    </div>
    
    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2>Powered By The Apocalypse</h2>
        Deathless is part of the PBTA school of games, which are based on <a href="https://lumpley.games/apocalypseworld/">Apocalpyse World</a> by D. Vincent and Meguey Baker.  If you're familiar with other pbta games (possibly: Masks, Dungeon World, or Monster of the Week), then you probably know what you're in for, more or less.
        <br><br>
        If you're new to PBTA games, here's what you're in for: the experience is light on rules, heavy on the narrative, and has strong opinions about which stories and spaces the game is best at exploring.

        <h2>The Conversation</h2>
        Playing this game is, fundamentally, a conversation between the people at the table.  The Master of Ceremonies (or MC), who takes the role of the world around the players, describes what's happening and asks the Players what they do.  The Players then tell the MC (or another player) how they act, and ask what happens next.  This continues as the story unfolds and arcs run their course.  The rules of the game should be treated as a participant in the conversation, too.  They'll interject when necessary, most often to help arbitrate differences.
        <br><br>
        Like any good conversation the game works best with a couple goals in mind.  There are no formal rules about who gets to talk and when, people contribute when they feel like it.  Everyone should have an opportunity to add to the conversation.  The topic should always move forward to new and interesting spaces.  Everyone takes part in directing the content, towards the things they want to explore, and away from the things they don't.
        <br><br>
        All the things said at the table sum up to create "the fiction".  Since the fiction is the story, that means every person involved is a co-author.  No one person at the table has special agency over the conversation that others do not.  We all play to find out what happens.

        <h2>Players</h2>
        Each player creates a character (a Player Character, or PC), one of the deathless, whom they control for the lifespan of the story.  These characters all have unique history, relationships, and compulsions, and the player's job is to bring out those features in dramatic context.
    </div>
    
    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2>Master of Ceremonies</h2>
        The MC puppets the world around the PCs, acting out the Non-Player Characters (aka, NPCs) and their motives and reactions.  Thier job, by pulling at these strings, is to maintain the tempo and tension of the game.  Like the other people at the table they may arrive with topics in mind (or they might not, planning ahead isn't necessary) but they, too, are here to discover the story, not to prescribe it.
    </div>

    <div class="spaceAbove">
        <h2>Agendas</h2>
        Deathless is not designed to play all possible stories and games.  It wants to investigate humanity, weakness, and character faults.  To have the players question, "what have I done?", more than they ask, "how do I want to do it?".  The scope is fantastical, but from a ground-level perspective, setting the supernatural as a foil to ourselves to see how that makes us, people, more interesting.  If a character seeks to slay a god, we shouldn't ask if they have the power to do it.  We should ask what drives a person to kill their god, and why they will not be received as saviors on their return.
        <br><br>

        To steer the tone of play toward these stories, everyone at the table has an agenda.  The Players, the MC, secretly even the rules themselves.  These are guides, not rules.  Perhaps better said, they are goals.  The values you should reach for each and every time you have the spotlight.  Your game does not need to be only these things, but hopefully it contains these and more.

            <h3>Player Agendas</h3>         
            <blurb>
                <Options bullet="⇀" :options="[
                    'Play a real person: flawed, engaged, and aware.',
                    'Embrace all consequences.',
                    'Appreciate the fragility of good connections.',
                    'Don\'t be afraid to make different commitments than your fellow players.',
                ]" />
            </blurb>

            <h4>Play a real person: flawd, engaged, and aware</h4>
            Chracters should behave like real people.  They're at their best when: Flawed- able to make mistakes and act irrationally or in their own self-interest.  Engaged- seeking earnest and active involvement in what's going on around them.  Aware- thoughtful, introspective, and self-aware, just like the player.
    
            <h4>Embrace all consequences</h4>
            Characters in deathless are not superhuman.  The world around them is not hospitable.  Trouble and tragedy are an expected part of play.  If your goal is to avoid trial and failure you'll end up fighting the game itself.  Allow your character to experience hardship.  Dig into that, and explore it.

            <h4>Appreciate the fragility of good connections</h4>
            Your character cannot die, but that isn't the case for everyone in the world.  On the contrary, you're the exception, and part of living forever means enduring loss.  But loss doesn't make life worth living.  Accept loss, but live to find friendship, hope, love, and dedication.  Hold tight to those things.  Dig your fingers in and make the world pry them from your grip.

            <h4>Don't be afraid to make different commitments than your fellow players</h4>
            You and your fellow players might all be in this together, but that doesn't mean you'll always share the same outlook on the situation.  When you disagree with the path the others are heading down- or even further, you want try and stop them from walking it- go ahead and chase that conflict.  The rules are ready to handle your quarrels, and you should trust the table to bring things around again afterward.

        <h2>Playing Together</h2>
        While the game can be played with only two people (one MC and one Player), it's likely that you'll have two or more players at the table.  Like most rpgs, Deathless works best when the characters are frequently in scenes together.
