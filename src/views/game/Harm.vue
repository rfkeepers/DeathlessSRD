<h1 class="title">Harm</h1>
Harm is how Deathless engages with the pain and frustration and wounds that characters inflict on each other.  Any attack on a person is an attempt to Harm them.
<br><br>
The nuances of <em>Harm</em> are intentionally left out of most of the rules.  Questions of "how" and "how much" get resolved according to the fiction.  Harm is fictional harm.  A stabbed belly is a stabbed belly.  A severed limb is a severed limb.  Whatever flows from the moment, however the cause and effect makes sense in the conversation, those properties are most important.
<br><br>
Characters record the Harm they've suffered with <em>Tags</em>: brief statements that describe the damage.  Tags are not mechanics themselves.  They state the truth of the problem and little more.  "Busted jaw".  "Arrow to the knee".  "Gaslit".  The kind and severity of the Harm, and how it impacts the character, gets handled at the moment of its introduction.  Whenever it comes up in the fiction afterward the tags help paint a picture of the character living with it.
<br><br>
The text does hold a few opinions about dealing with Harm.  Categorizations more than anything, aids to help you quickly resolve the nature of the problem while the specifics remain in your hands.  The rules enforce three concepts: what kind of Harm is it, how severe is it, and how much is too much?

<h2>Insult and Injury</h2>
In Deathless, Harm encompasses more than bodily damage.  Vitriol and mind games have equal share in the space.  The text will, at times, separate the two categories with the terms <em>Injuries</em> (for bodily effects) and <em>Insults</em> (for emotional or mental damage).  Normally, moves will refer to Harm alone; in these cases you can invoke either category, insult or injury, in accordance with the fiction.  On the rare occasion that one or the other term is used, the Harm must match that type.

<h2>Pain</h2>
Harm severity funnels down to two categories, the less severe of which is called <em>Pain</em>.  If you have trouble deciding whether the Harm is more or less severe, focus on the intent of the fiction.  Is the character trying to send a message or make a statement?  That's Pain.  Are they trying to kill or break someone?  That's probably the next step up (see Conditions and Wounds below).
<br><br>
Player Characters can manage up to three Pain tags at a time.  After the third, all Harm escalates to the greater severity independent of the intent.  You don't need to fill out a characters Pain Tags first; skip straight to the greater severity when it makes sense.  Also Harm never downgrades from a Wound or Condition to Pain (unless a move specifies otherwise).  The character's situation only ever gets worse.
<br><br>
Injury and insult may both cause Pain.  A character who has been bullied and berated, intimidated and flustered, may not be in physical pain per se, but they're still in <i>a state</i>.  Somewhere beyond clear and conscious control of themselves.  That's what Pain tracks: how the character is pushed towards or across the line where they're no longer able to think rationally.  To the point where they get desperate, take risks and make mistakes, flinch, stumble, or hesitate.  The players are not required to act out the state of their pain.  Leave those symptoms under the hood if you want.  Nonetheless, that's the position their characters are in.

<h2>Wounds and Scars</h2>
Player characters have no Harm clock or HP.  Each has only a single box to track a <em>Wound</em> tag.  Once filled, the next injury causes death.  NPCs may not even have that.  Some, where it makes sense in the fiction, have a wound slot to fill like the players do.  For most: if a PC intends to kill an NPC, they do so.  Life in Deathless is not precious.  Combat is severe.  Murderous intent results in killing.
<br><br>
Healed wounds beget Scars.  You won't need to remember each and every cut; many of the wounds taken may be forgettable, a patch of mended skin with a story to tell, not much more.  For the rest, the missing limbs and digits, the burns and brands, damage to visible areas like the face and hands, those you'll want to record.  A character can list as many scars as they please.  The purpose is purely for fictional tracking and does not affect the character's state of health or capacity to take future Harm.

<h2>Conditions</h2>
The mental and emotional versions of a wound, <em>Conditions</em> track things like broken self image, severed attachments, and barely-contained resentment.  They affect the character's behavior at all times, similar to how a wound to affects movement.  Every tension near the source, any act which stretches or exercises a connection to it, all strain from the damage.
<br><br>
Mechanically, Conditions manifest as penalties to player rolls.  Each of the characters' stats have two slots for Conditions.  For each condition on a stat, the character takes -1 when they roll it.  This modifier remains as long as the Condition persists.
<br><br>
A note on severity: the important difference between Pains and Conditions is not always the toxicity of the attack, but instead the persistence of the result.  Pains disappear in short order, Conditions do not.  We don't always get a say in what greives or affronts us.  Sometimes, the insignificant shit you hold on, the emotinal pricks that still hurt despite all the opportunity to heal, that'll surprise you.  Keep that in mind when Conditions come into play: the lingering effects can be disproportionate compared to their source.

<h2>Healing</h2>
Wounds can mend with care: time, restraint, patience.  All the <em>things the characters won't have</em> in surplus.  In a rush you'll do what any desperate fool would do: go to one of those things that call themselves doctors, or find a pharmacist who'll pack the sores full of herbs, maybe stitch pieces back together yourself.  Or you die.  Funny thing about dieing when you're in the character's position: all your injuries get healed up in the process.
<br><br>

Conditions, unlike wounds, won't even mend with time or rest.  To heal a damaged mind you'll need to engage with the emotions directly.  Each stat has different specifics for engagement, but they all invoke one of two behaviors: you can fight back against the feeling (<em>Catharsis</em>), or give in to it (<em>Surrender</em>).  Or, your Persona might provide an alternative, a way to put that hurt into motion independent of the stat.
<br><br>
Play a Condition into the fiction according to the requirements of a removal trigger (such as Catharsis or Surrender) and, when the scene is over, you get to erase that Condition.  Triggering Condition removal is expected to be an <i>event</i>, not mere background noise or an offhand gesture.  If the scene didn't include the introduction of a new character, new clock, or a significant change in the relationship with an existing character, the insitgating player didn't take it far enough to count as a resolution trigger.  Because of this weight, each character can only resolve a single condition per scene, even if they meet multiple resolution triggers.

<h2>Sacrifices</h2>
Characters in Deathless don't fuck with danger and come out clean.  One of the MCs principles is, after all, <i><em>give nothing away freely</em></i>- and gambling is not payment.  When a character takes risks, when they throw themselves against bad odds or imminent danger, losses are expected.  Sure they might scrape by on a roll or two, eventually they're going to get hurt, and when they do they get to make a choice: take the Harm, or sacrifice something valuable to keep themselves in the scene.
<br><br>
<div class="squeeze">
    <SacrificesMustBeMade :leftLined="false" shaded ruled flat />
</div>
<br>
If you go looking for an alternative move, some check to see if you can keep your shit together or slip sideways around the problem, you won't find one.  The players don't get to throw their characters in over their heads and just hope for the best.  The MC doesn't get to throw danger at the players and just hope for the best.  The risk is always real, and to get through everyone needs to approach it head on or trade for a character's safety.

<h2>Negotiating Harm</h2>
Most of the time the game handles negotiations for you.  First you let the moves have their say (you want to pull a stunt?  okay, roll the move and watch the dice).  If the roll goes well then everyone gets on with the scene.  When it tanks, you look at the rules on Harm, figure out which ones match the fiction and deal with the aftermath according to those rules.  Then, everyone gets on with the scene.  Great and good.
<br><br>
What happens if <em>the table can't decide</em> what move (if any) you're able to trigger?  A soldier has you at spearpoint, can you Overwhelm them without first getting stabbed?  You're abandoned in a cell, do you just suffer the maddening isolation, or can you thwart it somehow?  On your knees in front of the chopping block in the city center, in front of bloodthirsty crowd, the sheriff lashes out accusations about you and your ken; the abuses of this turncoat bastard churn your stomach, but is there anything at all you can roll to avoid taking another Condition?
<br><br>
Of course, at your table, you get to make these decisions however you want: hack and bend the game this way and that.  But the foundation of the game, the advice it gives the MC, the reason it makes you offer Sacrifices instead of a roll to gamble through the risk, is that you are not always in control of the moment.  The players' characters do not have the power to choose what does and doesn't hurt them, or what danger they can and cannot ignore.  No negotiations: you'll take a spear to the chest, scream into the lonely dark, and reek of vengence and impotence.

<h2>NPC Harm</h2>
Non-playable characters, the lot controlled by the MC, don't track all this complexity like the players' characters do.  Think of them more like having a single state that shifts according to their needs or situation.  They're either in pain, or they aren't.  Pissed off or thinking clearly.  Wounded or healthy.  Dead, or alive.  That state switches as the fiction dictates, with each effect giving the NPC a Tag.  They might take "kicked in the ribs" to show they're in Pain, or "one-upped by Flynn" if they're in a mood.  NPCs can take as many tags as the MC wants to give them.  There's not a rigor to the quantity.
<br><br>
However, where the PCs have layers of rules to dictate whether a Harm causes Pain or Wounds, damage or death, NPCs tend to take what they're given.  What happens, happens.  If a someone goes in for the kill on an NPC, don't turn to the rules about tracking wounds: they're an NPC, they die.  NPC states should shift mercilessly.  Expect them to have little or no protection, and no way to hold out.  This does mean that both the Players and the MC need to know the intent of their actions as part of their action: are they trying to kill or wound, cause a little pain or put someone in a mood?  If they don't know, if they're acting out and hoping for the best, the result is always the worst case scenario.
