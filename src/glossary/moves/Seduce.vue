        When you <b>entice someone</b> to turn their attention away from all else and come find you, <Roll glamour/>.  <em>S:</em> They'll come to you, on your terms (where, when, with whom).  <em>P:</em> They'll meet with you, but you only control one:
        <Options bullet="â‡€" :options="[
            'The time and place.',
            'They come alone, with others, or send people on their behalf.',
            'They let you bring people with you.',
        ]" />

        The background for this move concerns me more than the move itself.  <i>Fatale</i> is a pretty loaded concept thanks to his noir history.  Its context could color the players choice to use the background more-so than the move itself, thanks to things like gender norms and cultural precursors.  That said, I haven't found a playbook for this particular move (and I think the move works well enough to keep) besides that.  So here it stands.
