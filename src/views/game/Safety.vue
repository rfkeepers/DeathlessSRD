    Safety
</h1>

The mechanics in this game involve breaking people, gaslighting, self-harm, domination, and other acts of malice.  You will engage with cruelty and viciousness.

At this point you've (hopefully) read the agendas and recognized the tone I'm trying to set.  Whether you have or not, it bears repeating: Deathless is about difficult topics.  The players should, if the MC follows their principles, find themselves pressed into situations they don't want to be in.  The MC should, if the players engage with the mechanics, be something blah blah stepping stones.

In order to allow that to happen, you must trust the other people at the table, and feel safe to tell this story together with them.
<br><br>

Trust and safety are not a switch that can be toggled.  The nature of role playing, improvisation, and inhabiting another character means we all, at times, find ourselves in territory that we did not, despite intentions, expect to enter.  We may say, do, and feel things that we didn't think we ever would.  We can surprise ourselves to find that a line was crossed, especially when we were the one to cross it.  These revelations can, when handled appropriately and in the correct environment, encourage valuable discussion and introspection.  Outside of that environment we risk hurting each other, and that is never the goal.
<br><br>

Finally, please keep in mind that you, the individual, are in charge of your well-being and safety.  The game can hand you the tools, but it will not use them for you.  Open communication with your fellow players is your responsibility.  Using the tools to communicate your feelings is your responsibility.  Respecting and supporting your fellow players when they use the tools is your responsibility.  The tools below are a minimal recommendation for maintaining safety and trust at your table.  If you have additional tools you'd like to use, you are welcome and encouraged to incorporate them.

<h2>Before</h2>
Before means both "before you decide to play this game" and also "before each session that you play".  Likewise, it doesn't mean "only before, and no other time".  You can come back and revisit these any time you need.  But at minimum, make sure you review them before you play.

<h4>CATS</h4>
Everyone should be able to agree on the following: Concept, Aim, Tone, and Subject matter.  Make sure there is consensus at the table about what you're playing and where it's taking you.

<h4>Lines and Veils</h4>
A line expresses a hard limit, a boundary dividing what may and may not appear in the game.  A veil describes concepts that are allowed, but that shouldn't be visited in detail.  Players may declare these publically, or they may share them in private with the MC.  Either way, in the end, everyone at the table should have access to the lines and veils in use.

<h2>During</h2>
<h4 class="noTopMargin">X Card</h4>
Depending on your circumstance the X may be a physical card which players can reach out and touch, or it may be the act of saying, typing, or showing an X.  A player may tap the X card any time that they are uncomfortable with the current scene.  Once tapped, the scene either changes course or cuts to somewhere else.  No questions asked, no explanations needed.

<h4>Support Flower</h4>
The support flower is similar to the X card, but more nuanced in execution.  It allows for participants to request that the scene stop (red), but also for it to slow down or proceed with caution (yellow).  It also allows participants to ask for more, or to dig in deeper (green) when they like where the scene is headed.

<h4>Open Door Policy</h4>
Participation in the game is not required.  Anyone may leave or disconnect for any reason, without fear of judgement from others.

<h2>After</h2>
<h4 class="noTopMargin">Debriefs</h4>
Everyone at the table should have an opportunity to check in with each other and address feelings.  This can be done in private between participants, or with the group as a whole.  It isn't necessary to wait for the end of the session to debrief.  Taking breaks in-between scenes, especially to follow up after an emotionally charged moment, is a great time to administer aftercare.
