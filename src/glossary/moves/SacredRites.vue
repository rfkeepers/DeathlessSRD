        The outcomes on this move are a little wonky.  The first option is basically a rehash of `gaze into the abyss`.  I really like the second option, and maybe the best way forward is to rewrite the move around that entirely.  "when you ritural to shape the world... h: if possible, s: maybe not obvious, p: maybe not welcome".  I think I like that better.
