<h1 class="title">Harm</h1>
Harm is how Deathless engages with the pain and frustration and wounds that characters inflict on each other.  Any attack on a person is an attempt to Harm them.
<br><br>
The nuances of Harm are intentionally left out of most of the rules.  Questions of "how" and "how much" get resolved according to the fiction.  Harm is fictional harm.  A stabbed belly is a stabbed belly.  A severed limb is a severed limb.  Whatever flows from the moment, however the cause and effect makes sense in the conversation, those properties are most important.
<br><br>
Characters record the Harm they've suffered with Tags: brief statements that describe the damage.  Tags are not mechanics themselves.  They state the truth of the problem and little more.  "Busted jaw".  "Arrow to the knee".  "Gaslit".  The kind and severity of the Harm, and how it impacts the character, gets handled at the moment of its introduction.  Whenever it comes up in the fiction afterward the tags help paint a picture of the character living with it.
<br><br>
The text does hold a few opinions about dealing with Harm.  Categorizations more than anything, aids to help you quickly resolve the nature of the problem while the specifics remain in your hands.  The rules enforce three concepts: what kind of Harm is it, how severe is it, and how much is too much?

<h2>Insult and Injury</h2>
In Deathless, Harm encompasses more than bodily damage.  Vitriol and mind games have equal share in the space.  The text will, at times, separate the two categories with the terms Injuries (for bodily effects) and Insults (for emotional or mental damage).  Normally, moves will refer to Harm alone; in these cases you can invoke either category, insult or injury, in accordance with the fiction.  On the rare occasion that one or the other term is used, the Harm must match that type.

<h2>Pain</h2>
Severity funnels down to two categories, the less severe of which is called Pain.  If you have trouble deciding whether the Harm is more or less severe, focus on the intent of the fiction.  Is the character trying to send a message or make a statement?  That's Pain.  Are they trying to kill or break someone?  That's probably the next step up (see Conditions and Wounds below).
<br><br>
Player Characters can manage up to three Pain tags at a time.  After the third, all Harm escalates to the greater severity independent of the intent.  Filling those Tags is not a requirement, more severe Harm never downgrades to Pain (unless a move specifies otherwise).  The character's situation only ever gets worse.
<br><br>
Injury and insult (perhaps in contrast to what their names imply) may both cause Pain.  A character who who has been bullied and berated, intimidated and flustered, may not be in physical pain per se, but they're still in <i>a state</i>.  Somewhere beyond clear and conscious control of themselves.  That's the goal of Pain, to track how the character is pushed towards or across the line where they're no longer able to think rationally.  To the point where they get desperate, take risks and make mistakes, flinch, stumble, or hesitate.  The players are not required to act out the state of their pain.  Leave those symptoms under the hood, if you want.  Nonetheless, that's the position their characters are in.

<h2>Conditions</h2>
The mental and emotional counterpart to severe bodily wounds: caustic baggage of broken self image, barely-contained resentment and severed attachments.  Conditions affect the character's behavior at all times, similar to how a wound to affects movement.  Every tension near the source, any act which stretches or exercises a connection to it, all strain from the presence.
<br><br>
Mechanically, Conditions manifest as penalties to player rolls.  Each of the characters' stats have two slots for Conditions.  For each condition attached to a stats, the roll takes a -1 modifier (down to a minimum of 1).  This modifier remains as long as the Condition goes unaddressed.
<br><br>
A note on severity: the important difference between Pains and Conditions is not always the toxicity of the attack, but instead the persistence of the result.  Pains disappear in short order, Conditions do not.  We have all, in our lives, given real emotional devotion to minor slights and disagreements, sometimes harboring the feeling at length.  What's more, it can surprise us to discover how difficult it becomes to let go of the feeling.  Keep that in mind when Conditions come into play: the lingering effects are, at times, disproportionate to their cause.

<h2>Wounds and Scars</h2>
Player characters have no Harm clock or HP.  Each has only a single box to track a Wound tag.  Once filled, the next injury causes death.  NPCs may not even have that.  Some, where it makes sense in the fiction, have a wound slot to fill like the players do.  For most: if a PC intends to kill an NPC, they do so.  Life in Deathless is not precious.  Combat is severe.  The intent to kill results in killing.
<br><br>
Healed wounds beget Scars.  You won't need to remember each and every cut; many of the wounds taken may be forgettable, a patch of mended skin with a story to tell, not much more.  For the rest, the missing limbs and digits, the burns and brands, damage to visible areas like the face and hands, those you'll want to record.  A character can list as many scars as they please.  The purpose is purely for fictional tracking and does not affect the character's state of health or capacity to receive future wounds in any way.

<h2>Sacrifices</h2>
Characters in this game don't have much opportunity to dance with danger and come out clean.  It's one of the MCs principles, after all- <i>give nothing away freely</i>- and gambling is not payment.  When a character takes risks, when they throw themselves against bad odds or imminent danger, losses are expected.  If they save themselves they'll have to make a trade.
<br><br>
The handling here is covered by the basic move (link here)<b>Sacrifices Must Be Made</b>(link here), but the design still warrants explanation.

<h2>Dealing Harm</h2>
You might notice in the (link-needed)Basic Moves(link-needed) that there isn't a move for dealing Harm.

<h2>Healing</h2>
Even though they aren't a part of your body, and you aren't waiting on a biological healing process, Conditions won't disappear with time and rest.  To get rid of these feelings you have to engage with them directly.  Each stat has different specifics for engagement, but they all invoke one of two behaviors: fighting back against the feeling (Catharsis), or giving in to it (Surrender).  Play the Condition into the fiction by meeting the requirements of a Catharsis or Surrender, as appropriate to the stat, and you get to erase that Condition at the end of the scene.

<h2>Death</h2>
